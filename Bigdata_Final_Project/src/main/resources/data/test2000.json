Rand McNally, are you listening?First thing I did after charging it was connect it to my laptop and install the software and then attempt to update it.  The software detected a problem with my update and wanted my home address so I could be sent a patch on an SD card.  Hello?  I don't think I'm all that unusual; my home address is a PO box that a friend checks weekly and that I might get to check every six months or so.  I live in my truck and at truck stops.  If you need to make a patch available on an SD card then you should send the SD cards to the truck stops where the devices are sold.  I ran the update program multiple times until the program said that the TND 700 was completely updated.I programmed in the height (13'6\"), the length (53') and the weight (80,000#) of my rig and told it that I preferred highways.  I was parked at a truck stop in the Cincinnati OH area.  My next pickup was about 15 miles down the same freeway but on the other side of it a couple of blocks.  My cell phone GPS (Sprint) said to get on the freeway to get to my pickup.  The TND 700 routed me thru 23 miles of residential streets before finally getting me to my pickup.  Very exciting, especially since every time I refused to turn down a street posted \"No Trucks\" the TND 700 took almost 5 minutes to figure a re-route, and it happened multiple times on that short trip.I decided to give it another chance.  After my pickup on the north side of Cincinnati just off of I-75 I needed to head to Phoenix AZ via I-71.  Easy route is to just hop on I-75 and drive west and south to the intersection of I-71.  Indeed, that is what my cell phone advised.  The TND 700, however, wanted to route me over surface streets across the city and pick up I-75 on the other side of the city.  I turned it off and the next time I passed a truck stop of the same chain I purchased it at I returned it and got my money back.I then spent $30 on a cheap printer.

Just restarted it and it picked up on my route right where it should have. The exit lane screen has been spot on every time and gives me plenty of time to get my rig into the appropriate lane safely.

Even if it didn't, the supplied 12-volt and AC chargers take care of getting the battery up to speed.My complaints are relatively minor:Battery life when it is unplugged isn't great. However, since I use it plugged in in the cab 95% of the time, it doesn't create too much of a problem.The announcement of state borders coming up is nice but it doesn't tell you (or show you on the map display) what state you are in and/or going into. Again, a minor issue because I know where I am but all my other GPS units had this feature. For $500 smackers, I don't expect this kind of slip-up.There is a Micro SD slot on the unit and I bought a card for it. Unfortunately, the manual has absolutely no information on using it.

I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I'll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.pros:Large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons:inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated POI information.Non-truck specific routings.Cost.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "09 9, 2010", "summary": "1st impression"}

I've driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they'll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6\" bridges when I'm 13'6\". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin.

Has better graphics than Cobra 7\".  It does have lane assist which is important when in large metro areas and need to be in correct lane for exits, etc Atlanta, GA.  I have read some of the negative comments written earlier and I do not have those problems.  Sure, sometimes it does not give the fastest or the simplest route but it has never sent me down a non truck route like all the prior gps i have had in the past.  I am a car carrier so I set truck size at 13' 8\" and it has kept me from going down roads with 13'6\" bridges.  The only negative comment I have is that it constantly changes map views from city to county to state way to often.  Other than this, I love the fact that:  1) it shows mileage to destination, arrival time (which you can change to time left),  2) shows the city, county and state you are current located (how often we truck drivers pull over at a rest area or truck stop and wonder what city we are located).  3) large 7\" color screen for easy viewing and screen changes automatically for night time driving  4) list truck poi and non truck poi (wish Rand McNally had a feature that would let us send them an update for poi, maybe when we get at a Loves that use to be a Pilot, just tap on the screen and edit info, then when I connect gps to computer for weekly update the map will get updated.  5) able to update construction info by linking gps to computer and get updates given to Rand McNally by the states.  Unfortunately like usual  the states are mostly behind on updates given to Rand McNally.  This is where we the consumer should have the ability to tap screen and make corrections and send it to Rand McNally.  Many times I have gone into areas that it said \"Construction Ahead\" and no construction is being done because it has been completed.  6)  speed limits of highways and Interstates and shows your current speed just below it (also shows truck speed limits in red) Still the states have to report these limits to Rand McNally and as usual they are slow on reporting.  But still most of the time 95% it is correct.  7)  great truckers tools like driving hours left.  It automatically changes to driving when truck has moved for more than 1 mile and changes to off duty if it is idle for 15 minutes.  It lets you know when you have 1 hour left to drive and that driving time has expired. You reset every day manually.  Also have total hours worked for day and hours left to work for the week. You will have to manually override this sometimes because it doesn't distinguish off duty and on duty hours well, you have to manually tell it you are on duty.  I just manually configure at the end of the day.  The important one is driving hours and end of the week hours.  8)  service reminders for your perimeters you set, such as 8000 and 16000 services.  You reset manually when completed.  9)  able to set many multiple stops set and ability to add more stops in route  10) loud enough to hear spoken text to speech street names over engine noise (and believe me my truck is loud)  11) ability to save your own poi (I do it all the time)  12) it tells you when you are 3 miles from approaching a weight station (you can configure it up to 5 miles)  13) it tells you when you are 1 mile from state border and tells you when you cross border and what state you are in.  14) it tells you all mileage you driven that day and mileage by state and mileage by day.  saves info for 1 year.

The screen is great. It's pretty clear and seems tough enough not to need a screen protector. The plastic that was on the screen out-of-the-box left glue residue which was a pain to remove. It comes with a stylus that works great but navigating around with your finger is easy and works just fine. I usually just have to tap it with the back of my finger. When you get it, charge it for a few hours before you use it at all. I'm not sure if my over sized good laptop even was charging it. So use the wall outlet. It comes with nice cables for both wall outlet and 12 volt, as well as a good usb cable. The supplied mount is excellent and easy to use. No tools required. The screen part snaps into another flat part on the mount and you have to make sure it's clicked in all the way or it will drop out.. AFTER IT IS FULLY CHARGED, plug it in the pc and get your first free lifetime update. The software loads fine and tries to start up each time you use the computer. I stopped that and made a shortcut to start it myself. There are no options I saw to disable it from auto starting... I used ccleaner/tools/startup to disable it. The program DOES use a lot of resources when running, but you only need to update once in a while.My first drive with it was Tampa to El Paso. It saves my height, width, weight and hazmat class. I was hauling hazmat. It gave a killer route that would have saved time but I had to alter it for the company fuel stops and routes. It tells you everything you need to know. Where travel centers are and what they have, scales and weigh stations and much more which can all be symbols on the map if you wish. YAY now i don't have to buy an iphone. Some stuff in the manual says parts are for future use so I'm guessing the updates are going to give even more. You can manually adjust the zoom. The automatic screen zooming works great. One time it was dark and cloudy with a cool looking sky and I looked at my screen and saw the exact same thing as I approached a ramp. You can save all your addresses and stops and put notes in them for phone numbers and gate codes etc. Then make groups (folders) for your addresses so you can find them even quicker. I sat there for 9 hours like a jerk and typed in all the company terminals and drop yards. It was fun. I'm saving each new stop now with notes too.Once the GPS kinda got confused and mixed up my current rout with a completed one. It may have been my fault but I don't think so. I just restarted it real quick and it worked fine again.I also used it in my car. It's easy to switch between truck and car mode. I drive a medium large car and the 7 inch unit was a bit to big and did obstruct my view a little.The voice is fine and easy to adjust. The thing is nice and it works good. The traffic and road updates for life. I don't have to use internet or buy a netbook (with gps) and software... I'm happy I got it. I don't get lost anymore.I like the TND 700. I'd just like to tell Rand Mcnally that since we spent as much on this as for a laptop, please make this the best and keep updates and innovations coming to us for the next few years at least. I'm kinda expecting you to make the software on the unit and on the TND DOCK (pc software) a bit better. I'd also like to be able to set up routes INTERSTATE to INTERSTATE to INTERSTATE to FINAL in order to comply with company route solutions. Sometimes we can't take all those better routes the unit suggests. You can make this worthy of five stars with just a little more effort.  Well, I gotta haul A$$.

The HCS12 is pretty easy to work with if you can keep the registers in order (in your head) It has many of the features you might need like I/O compare, ADC, Timer, (I use these the most).. The board comes with an bread board attachment which can be handy. When it came it looked brand new straight from Axion. I bought an serial to USB cable from \"plugable\" which I would recommend if your laptop does not have D9 port. I installed the Serial to USB driver. Hooked up the EVB. Installed HCS12 compiler and loader. Found the Serial Channel and loaded a program in the CD and it was running in about 15 minutes. So I know it works of of basic programs. I am looking into getting Codewarrior for HCS12. They do have code size restriuctions which I think is kind of dirty but there are ways around it. It would help programming the Chip(writing in Assembly is hell). Make sure you read the data sheet of freescale to see if the chip works for your needs. This chip only has 4K EEPROM memory 512K Byte Flash, EEPROM 14K Byte SRAM, which I think is enough for programming a cheap robot to detect landmines.

No problem with the Blue Logger GPS but my complaints are as follows:1. Delorme did not include the Blue Logger Manager software on the HH. Now they want to sell it separately for additional $39. Very Weird marketing strategy indeed.2. The software for the pocket PC is very difficult to use, not very intuitive. It seems the hand held software was developed as an afterthought from the software for the pc. It is poorly designed, and appeared was not fully tested by normal users prior to releasing to market.3. It is very cumbersome and slow to determine a route. Even with a 620 MHz Axim, it is slow. Worse yet, the route is often wrong. FOr example, this afternoon I use SA2005 to determine a route to a friend's house. Had I followed that route, I would come to a dead end street and have to back track about 10 miles to get to another correct route to my destination. Luckily, I decided to use my paper map. Later, I tried Microsoft Mapping on the internet and it actually gave me the correct routing. Last week for another location, SA2005 found the wrong location for a given address which would take me about 4 miles off. Luckily, I knew where it was and ignored the routing from SA2005 HH.4. Many other mapping softwares for HH will allow one to use it with 1 hand and often with the finger. But not with SA2005 HH. After 2 weeks of using it, I found myself going back to my old paper map. For example, if I had not calculated a route and just simply use the GPS and map to travel, the software only show the street I was on but no name given and no street name shown for upcoming cross streets. It does not help when you are lost.5. SA2005 maps seems to be several years old and not very up to date. I guess that's why Delorme does not want to clearly advertise this issue.I am seriously considering giving up SA2005 and consider this as my $50 learning mistake, and looking at Microsoft Street & Trip 2005 or later in 1Q 2005, IGuidance who is supposed to have the latest map.I am not alone in this as several other users have also complained on delorme user forum.

You can measure a point to a few inches, when things go well.If you spend thousands of dollars you can get a nice GPS receiver and software for doing this, like surveyors do. The Blue Logger and PostPro let you do the same thing, though not quite as precisely, for a few hundred dollars. You can't use just any GPS receiver - it has to record information separately for every GPS satellite.So, the Blue Logger is the only product out there that can do this unless you spend thousands.On the plus side is the fact that this is even possible. And, the Logger feels like a nice solid little device.On the minus side, though, Blue Loggers just barely work. They're probably the most unreliable and difficult electronic product I've ever tried to use. They keep malfunctioning. To make matters worse, I bet other companies that might have tried to put similar products out there would not want to now, because these things are convincing consumers that postprocessing is difficult.I keep using them because I really want the results, but I curse their unreliability every time I do. And this would have been such a perfect product, if they'd made them work right.I gave them a moderate rating because it's great that there is any product out there at all for doing this. If there were competing products I'd have to give Blue Loggers a thumbs down completely.If you want to see bright people struggling bravely with a cursed and evil product, go look at the Blue Logger Receiver forum at delorme.com.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "03 7, 2008", "summary": "Allows postprocessing to get submeter accuracy"}

You should also spray some WD40 to lubricate the joints prior to mounting it to the wall so the arm swings easily. You will also need a stud finder to attach the mount to wooden studs in the wall. Having the other person hold the TV while you screw in the four screws to the TV mounting plate is a must. It took my wife and I about 40 minutes to mount the TV to the wall from start to finish.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2012", "summary": "Good but not great"}

I thought I would address some of the negatives I read and have now experienced.  One review talked about how tight the mount was to move.  There is a simple answer to that...loosen the bolts on those joints!  Others mentioned how it was a two person job to mount.  While it might take two people to figure out where to mount it, I mounted this in an RV six feet high by myself.  Just take the bolts off of the bracket with the included wrench, mount it, then put the bracket back on.  I also read that the TV was hard to put on once the mount was on the wall.  There is a top screw on the middle joint that can be removed.  Then mount the bracket to the TV.  Then put the middle section back together by simply sliding it onto the post it came off of.  I don't travel with the TV mounted in the RV so I take it off and put it on this same way and never struggle at all.  Another review talked about the mount being out of square with the TV.  This mount is endlessly adjustable and the tilt and pitch both of the TV can be adjusted.  All in all this is a solid mount with endless adjustments.  It even includes a small loop to help with cable management.  For the money, I can't believe there is something out there better.

I installed it in less than 1/2 hour and am very happy with the results.PROS:-Comes with all of the hardware you'll need-Comes with some extra hardware of which I have NO IDEA what it is there for.  I suspect it's a 'universal' hardware pack for several models and not all hardware is used for all models, but it's nice to have a little 'extra' (which is always better than not enough!)-The included Level is nice... well it's cheap but it works!-The instructions did a decent enough job of explaining how to install the unit.CONS:-Metal is just a tad on the flimsy side.  I have no problems trusting it with my &lt;30lb television but if I were to mount something closer to its maximum rated weight of 55lbs, I think I would be quite a bit nervous about it holding up.-The holes in the base were just a little bit too wide for my wall stud.  I think the particular stud I was installing it onto was a typical 2X4 and if centered, the left and right side holes were just a little too far to grab both sides of the stud.  I had to reposition it so that the center holes were aligned to the left side of the stud, and that the right side holes were aligned to the right side of the stud.  As a result, I was only able to install four of the six bolts to hold it in place, but I don't feel it will be an issue with my 28LB television.  If your house uses wider studs this probably wouldn't even be an issue.-The metal does sag just a little bit with the weight of the television on it.  I mounted the base just a little bit \"off level\" to help compensate for this, and had no problems getting the television level using the adjustments available to me.CONCLUSION:  All in all It's not a bad unit.. ESPECIALLY for the price.  Yes I would have liked to see a sturdier unit, but when you take into account the &lt;$30 price tag, it's an excellent bargain.  I don't think I'll have any issue with a static mounting of my TV in the corner of the bedroom *BUT* if you are considering installing this unit for a television that will see a lot of traffic, constant repositioning, etc... then you might want to spend more money on something sturdier.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "05 31, 2011", "summary": "It works!"}

Using the extension arms, the holes on the back of the TV lined up and after tightening the screws, it was very solid as well. Make your connection first, then tighten. The bolt that attaches the TV to the mount arm just before the final step to adjust the position of the screen, seems a little small, but it holds. It took me about 20 minutes to install.

And it carried another solution of aligning the top of the mount and the top of TV because of the ceiling proximity. I could orient upper brackets horizontally and use a steeper angle for lower brackets. Because of a plethora of holes in the arm plate I could accommodate for any geometry. Amazingly, this kit comes with brackets-extenders if you need for weird TV form factors. The construction is very sturdy and there is no gaps in the joints. The TV can be turned and moved to any direction without skewing or loss of horizontal. Because of the extended arm it has another great potential by attaching your great old speakers to the back of the TV holding brackets.

The mount was more than adequate for my light weight TV. It can be adjusted to swivel and tilt. The only negative was that while the plate mounted to the back of the TV with the screws provided, the lower left corner interfered with the power plug. Video Secure can provide a mount with a smaller plate. Rather than return my mount for the smaller plate, I chose to use a hacksaw and removed an approximately one by two inch corner in order to permit the plug to enter the TV. So with that caution in mind, I would recommend this product very highly. If I had ordered the smaller plate originally I would have rated it 5 Stars. I was able to do the job without any help.

This arm comes with all needed mounting hardware for either masonry or wall stud mounting as well as a set of 4 screws for several sizes of panel mounting screws.  It also comes with a small wrench for two different sizes of hex heads on the arm and an allen wrench for one of the arm adjustments.  It is at least a two man operation to attach the flat screen after the arm is attached to the wall.  I mounted mine on a stud in the wall.  For stud mounting you use two of the six mounting hex head lag screws that come with it.  It doesn't say exactly in the directions but you should use a 1/4\" drill bit to pre-drill the holes in the stud.  I would not recommend trying to use the included hex wrench to tighten down the wall mounting lag screws, you need more leverage to tighten it than it provides; use a crescent wrench or other longer hex wrench.  I used a stud finder to locate the studs accurately.  Make sure you do not have obvious pipes or electrical going through the wall at the chosen location.  They can throw off some stud finders.  If you want to quickly adjust one of the arm adjustment screws it also contains a replacement screw that has a slip bar top lever so that it can be loosened and tightened without a wrench.  There is one optional cable management loop that attaches to the bottom of the middle of the arm.  It could use one more at the wall, but that is easy to improvise.  The flat panel we have is 32\" and 25 lbs. and works well for the mounting arm.I really like this product for this price.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "10 4, 2010", "summary": "Excellent low cost movable arm"}

There are two \"tools\" provided. One is a hex key and it works. The other in a small box wrench. Throw the box wrench away as it is at least 1mm larger than the lags bolts provided and thus slips when used, could cause minor injury, and is totally useless. BTW, the pre- mounted bolts, as shipped, are torqued on tightly, watch the fingers and hands so as not to mash them once the torque pressure is released as you untighten them.  I strongly suggest using your own tools. Either a racket wrench or correct size box wrench. The lag bolts provided for mounting are large and should be mounted in a wall stud 2x4. To prevent splitting the stud, drill progressively larger pilot holes until you acheive the size correct for the mounting the lag bolts. The instructions are minimal and vague. For instance, there is a small component provided which looks like a screw cap with a small barbell thru the top.  Interesting, but here is no explanation what it is for. Also the mounting lag bolts should be six in number; only five were included in my shipment, so I winged it with a lag bolt of my own.  Mounting the TV to the TV plate has to be somewhat intuitive; screws are provided for most configurations. In summary, I liked this product but it has the snags, the bewilderments, and the amusements and the WTFs that plague most manufactured products made in China. For the price, we don't get German engineered quality or Swiss logic.  Bottom line is that it works.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "04 12, 2012", "summary": "Good bracket, couple snags."}

That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "03 15, 2013", "summary": "Well made, Excellent Value"}

Given that this mount can support almost twice the weight of my TV, it was a little bit of overkill but better safe than sorry.  The unit is already assembled right out of the box and just needs to be attached to the TV and a wall stud.  I made a quick template by rubbing a blank piece of paper on top of the wall bracket with a pencil. I then used a stud finder to locate the nearest studs where I wanted the TV to be and taped the template to the wall.  I used a drill driver to make pilot holes for the lag screws which helps greatly with getting them in.  I was able to use four of the lag screws.  There is a plastic two piece lag screw cover (included) that clicks together easily over the lag screw heads to make for a clean look.  The wall bracket allows for different screw patterns for easier installation.  Once I had the mount secured to the wall, it was time to attach the TV to its bracket.  This took two of us to do it quickly.  One lifted the TV and the other pressed the bracket flush against the TV and hand tightened the four screws that go into the back of it. This allowed the TV to be supported easier while a screwdriver was used to finish tightening the four screws.  After that, it was just a matter of adjusting the angle of the mount for the best TV viewing.This thing works as advertised.  The extension arm works smoothly and without much effort.  The tilt function has a nut that loosens to allow for pivot adjustments.  The cord management system works well to bundle the various cables and makes for a clean look.

Why pay more for something that you will not see and does the same job as other high priced mounts. The only thing I did not like was the way the instructions have you mount the TV after the bracket is attached to the wall but like another reviewer stated, I removed the head from the arm, attached it to the TV and then reattached the head to the arm and slid the bolt that I removed back in. I did reverse the orientation of the bolt by having it drop in instead of pushing it in from the bottom. It made it much easier. After 15 years of having a TV on the edge of my dresser I finally freed that space up and have my TV mounted on the wall and I am very happy with this purchase.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "08 4, 2012", "summary": "Price is great for excellent product.

I mounted it on a wall and intended to use it extended to 180 degrees. At the 180 degree extension, there is very noticeable tilt, which gets worse each day, until the TV is tilting sort of comically. If you are just using it to watch a TV &#34;head-on&#34; the tilt probably won't matter to you, but if you are using it at any sort of angle for a large TV you will have the tilt problem. The arm is simply not designed properly to handle the 180 degree extension.Also, if you are new to this TV mount thing, note that this VESA 400 compatible mount will not necessarily work for your VESA 400 compatible TV. I discovered that not all VESA 400 mounts work with all VESA 400 TVs. I had to &#34;improvise&#34; to get this mount to work and could not use any of the mounting configurations in the instruction booklet. This problem had no bearing on the &#34;tilt&#34; problem described above. I don't really understand what the point is of listing VESA compatibility when it doesn't seem to actually indicate compatibility, but there must be some tech guru who has a complex and useless explanation for it somewhere.Otherwise, the installation was fairly easy.

Let me start off by saying it works as advertised.  But that won't get you 5 stars.  The problem is installation.  Maybe it's my own fault for thinking all TV wall mounts worked like the Peerless I had.  See, that one has a separate TV plate that you screw to the TV first.  Then you have the second piece (the actual wall mount) that you screw to the wall.  Once that's done, using the bracket mounted on the TV, you hang the TV on the wall mount and secure it with a single bolt.  One person can easily put a TV on the wall.Not so much with this one.  Yes, I will admit that once it's mounted, it's a more secure connection, but it's the mounting that's the problem.  You can't do it alone.  Depending on the weight of the TV, you will need at least one helper.  This mount is one piece, which means that you have to hold the TV to the wall-mounted plate while attaching it with screws.  That can get tricky, especially with heavier TVs (I used it for a while with my old LCD TV which weighs 40+ pounds).  They do get kudos for providing all the screws for all VESA types as well as a regular and an Allen wrench.Three stars for ease of installation, five stars for usability, for a combined four stars.

Polk recommends these speakers be mounted at least 2' off the wall to keep from muffling the rear facing bass port and this mount fits the bill to a T for a heck of a lot less expense than the typical center channel speaker stands sell for ... Bonus!BTW, these Polk Monitor 40s are essentially the same speaker as their purpose built center channel speakers for 1/2 the price as I got a pair of 'em for what Polk sells single center channel speakers, and .... got a 2nd one to use for the center channel for my BR system in the process. So long as you don't mind either standing them up as intended or that the Polk emblem ends up sideways when you lay 'em on their sides like I did, they make a great center channel speaker for a bargain price.This did require some inventive modifying with my die grinder and a cut off wheel to cut away most of the mounting pad intended for attaching to various monitors/Tvs, then a lil touch up painting after the cutting but what I ended up with was just what I needed. The cable management already in place works just as well for speaker wire as it would have for an HDMI or similar video cable too.Yeah, these are of Chinese manufacture, but I was unable to find a similar American made product, and let me assure you, I did try.  This is my second VideoSecu mount I've purchased as I have one for my 37&#34; Tv in the BR and both mounts are well made, came with ample mounting hardware for many different applications and are very sturdily built with a great overall &#34;fit and finish&#34;.Hey, VideoSecu, you guys have a great potential for an awesome wall mount center channel speaker mount in this product by simply modifying the mounting pad to easily use it for this purpose as I did, are ya listening?

Your television probably cost you several hundred dollars, so entrusting it to this wall mount is a big leap of faith.I received mine about three weeks ago, and since I'm not handy, I had my buddy help me. You better be ready to drill, because you're going to be mounting it into the wall with multiple screws/brackets. You have to know how to find the stud in your drywall...It took my friend and I about forty-five minutes to install the unit.Included with the wall mount is a tool, some sort of wrench you will need, but it was so poorly constructed that we wore it away so badly in the first few minutes that it no longer turned the included screws.So far, for the last month, the wall mount has held my 32\" television (which falls within the allotted weight) up to the wall. There are two caveats: firstly, I NEVER pull it out, articulate it, turn it... nothing. I don't trust the wall mount enough to do anything but leave the television flush against the wall. Secondly, make sure you have a level with you, not just for installation, but pretty much for the life of the wall mount so you can make sure your television is level from time to time, in case you bump it or move it ever so slightly.Well, that's all there is to say.

I have installed three others and I like this the best.  It extends enough with the second arm so that you can mount a large TV so that it fits in the corner of a room.  The TV will hide the actual wall mount and arms mounting to the back of the TV.  This one was installed thru a plaster drywall into cinder block wall.  I used  the 2 wall anchors and bolts provided in the mounting accessory pack.  The 42&#34; TV bolt pattern fit the mounting plate so I did not have to use the adjustable arms provided in the package.  Total installation time was less than 20 minutes.  I like the fact that you can tilt it, rotate it (makes it easy to get the TV level)  and move it in and out a great distance and it will go back pretty flush to the wall.  The instructions are easy to follow.

The wall plate also has a plastic cover that snaps on and hides the mounting bolts, giving the wall mounting plate a \"finished look.\"  The included instructions were well written, detailed and describe the mounting process in step by step fashion. (In my opinion, some of the best instructions I have seen for the half-dozen mounts I have installed.)  One definitely needs a stud sensor, electric drill and a good wrench to install the mount.  I used the mount on an older 42 inch plasma that weighs 60 lbs, so it will handle its rated weight, assuming both mounting bolts of the wall plate are properly secured in studs.  I have observed no \"sagging,\" but I would say the arm \"flexes\"  about 1 inch with my 60 lb TV attached and the arm fully extended.  In summary, I rate it 5 stars, and feel this is an excellent mount for the money, especially if one has a heavier (40-60 lb) TV with VESA mounting holes larger than 200x200.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 13, 2013", "summary": "Good mount for VESA mounting holes larger than 200x200"}

It mounted to the wall with no real problem, but since it is all one unit, you have to put the whole thing up, and then raise the TV up in the air, while you line up the screw holes in the plate with the holes in the TV back and get the screws started.  This is at least a two man operation, and our TV was small.  I cannot imagine doing this with a 32\" TV.  With the four screws in place and the TV up in the air, we started connecting the wires only to discover the cable connection was covered by the mounting plate.  Brought the assistant back, removed the TV from the mount, had to disassemble the mount to get the mounting plate off, then take a hacksaw and cut one corner off the mount plate to uncover the cable connection on the back of the TV when the plate is in place, and then put it all back together again.  The design of the mounting plate is such that it cannot be disconnected from the rest of the mount and then put on the back of the TV at ground level.  The plate needs to be able to be mounted on the TV back at ground level to make sure all connections for the wires are clear.  We got it up, and it works well, but having to do it all twice, and hacksaw a notch in the mount for the cable is not what I call \"easy installation\".", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "10 5, 2010", "summary": "Have your own hacksaw"}

But installation was a pain.  Unlike other similar low priced mounts, this does not have a separate plate that you mount to the TV then mount to the bracket.  You have to hold the TV up in position, align with bracket holes and start screws.  Try that on ladders 6 feet in the air,  with a 40 or 50 pound TV.  I bought some screws of proper size, cut off the head and used 2 as locating guides to get screw holes aligned.  Started 2 screws then replace my starter studs with screws. Made it easier but NOT easy.  Also adjustment is very difficult with TV installed.  Weight of TV binds the adjusting bracket when you loosen set screw.

I looked at another mount by the same company but it did not articulate so I was worried I wouldn't be able to achieve the viewing angles that I needed. So I found this one & went w/ it based on the high reviews. I could not be more pleased.1) PRICE - If you were to go to the big electronics store (BB) or the big box monster (WM) you would pay hundreds. I can't fathom those more expensive mounts doing anything that this one does not. Does it cook dinner for me? Why pay $100-$250 for a mount when you can get this one for $29.99 & oh, by the way have the confidence in 898 customer reviews averaging 4.5 stars at the time of this writing?2) FUNCTION - This mount is solid. It articulates to the left, to the right. It pans, it tilts. One small negative.....the plastic clips for routing wires are nearly useless. I took them off.3) WHATS IN THE BOX - Normally I would not comment on what an item comes with but in this case I was so impressed I felt it was worth mentioning. It comes w/ everything you need in neatly sealed and labeled plastic sleeves. It comes w/ lag bolts that everyone will use to mount to the wall stud. (mounting to a wall stud is required unless you are mounting to concrete) Then it has 9 different screw sets to mount the plate to the back of your TV. It has 2 washer sets for the mounting plate (based on if your TV has a flat or curved back). Then it has a spanner wrench for tightening the screw of the mounting plate. Then it also has 2 plastic anchors for mounting to a concrete wall. Last but not least are the VESA adaptors (which I did not need)4) WHAT YOU NEED THAT ISN'T INCLUDED -  Pencil / Level / Stud finder / Phillips screwdriver / Drill w/ a 7/32 drill bit / Socket wrench w/ a 13mm attachment.5) CONCLUSION - This is a no brainer. I have another 32\" that needs mounted. I think as soon as I click publish for this review I will be ordering another one.

The metal is indicative of much higher-priced models than the low price of this item. Once you have it mounted, it works great with a full range of motion and the tv feels very secure.The only problem I have is the installation process itself. You have to loosen all the nuts required for getting the range of motion, and it seems that the nuts were all tightened at the strongest-man-in-the-world competition. It was VERY difficult to get them to loosen initially.The other installation issue is that the extensions that are included to mount different size TVs did not align properly and the screws provided were the wrong height. The mount comes with a bunch of different screws with varying lengths and thickness, but none of them worked without modification. As a result of those two problems, I had to come up with a jury-rig solution to getting the four expansion pieces attached to our 400x400 TV (Sony Bravia). It's not a bad solution - putting the screw through one of the slats rather than an actual screw hole along with adding a couple washers to create tension with the too-long screws - but I'd rather it be truly universal as the description claims.But even with the installation difficulties, I'd still buy the product again because it's great quality for a low price.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2013", "summary": "Works great...once you go through the pain of getting it installed"}

Is it the same quality as the Sanus? No, but it has enough quality to perform its advertised claims.  I saw some reviews on here complaining about mount sag after install.  Now this is based on the 23 lb TV, but I'm not experiencing this problem.  The mount has 4 pivot points and after installation, ALL need to be tightened to the point that movement is allowed with intentional moderate force.  Out of the box, this mount would have sagged like others complained, but I'm guessing its left slightly loose to help ease the installation process.I won't hesitate to buy another one in the future if the need arises.  An excellent price ($30) for a good quality mount.  If you want a mount that you can do pull ups on after install, buy the Sanus (and pay 5x more to do it).  If you want a mount that you can safely hang and secure your TV on, save some cash and buy this mount.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2014", "summary": "Well worth the money"}

Installation was not done by me (I had a guy do it for me), and I also don't think I would've been able to do it myself.

I do plan to invest in a brand that's more sturdy though. All in all, I don't trust how it looks. I've been monitoring the wall-mounted plate everyday to make sure it's not starting to come out, and it really hasn't moved. I'm just not comfortable with how it appears and I've decided to not push back or pull forward at all. I just swivel it left or right.

Unfortunately, the arm was welded to the wall bracket at a slight angle, meaning that regardless of how it would mount it and the LCD would never be level.Also, the powder coating near one of the bolts had come off and I could see some rust already forming.I decided to see if the mount would be the right fit for the tv before returning, figuring I would just get a replacement and hope for the best. I'm glad I did because this led me to find two other issues.The first one I blame on the manufacturers, the second I would consider a design flaw of the LG lcd.The first issue is that the screws supplied to attach the bracket to the tv are too few and two short. The screws are only 12mm long, and would barely catch in the threads of the TV if they weren't recessed at all. Most mounting threads on lcds and plasmas are partially recessed. I stopped by my local Lowes and picked up two packs of similar screws (M4-70 or something to that affect). $0.80 a packet so not much of an expenditure, just a big hassle. I needed 20mm long screws to mount this to the tv, so a pretty fair difference over what was supplied. The manufacturer supplies several different thread and gauge options, but only one shallow length of each set.The second issue is that this universal mount covered the power and HDMI ports on the back of the 26le5300. Again, I think this is more of an issue with the tv then the mount, as they're situated rather high and central. Either way, it's something you'll want to check on your tv before ordering this product.I actually returned this and in its stead purchased a similar mount from the same company. TheVideoSecu Swing LCD Wall Mount 20 inch Extension 55 lb loading capacity for LCD TV Monitor Flat Screen VESA 75mm/100 mm 1USgets very high marks from me. It's basically the same arm with a 75x75 to 100x100 VESA head on it. This second arm did not have any of the manufacturing errors of the previous model and fit the back of my tv perfectly.I understand that it's a very affordable mount, and that most of my issues may have been resolved with a replacement. However, I just can't give this mount any higher rating than I have.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "09 4, 2010", "summary": "Poor Quality Control, May Block the Ports on Your TV"}

I have installed many different types of mounts, so I have a lot of experience with them.  The quality is decent, but there are some items of which you should be aware:* If you have a 600x400 VESA pattern mount on your TV (as I did for a 37&#34; LG), then be aware that the extension arms are &#34;maxed out&#34; at this size, which means you have zero flexibility.  Unfortunately for my TV, the center plate onto which the extension arms attach completely covered the inputs I needed to use.  This isn't completely the VideoSecu's problem, but since there is no flexibility at this size, I had to rig it together off-centered only using two screws on the bottom arms.* All of the mounts I have ever done have a tilt function, and this is by far the biggest pain I've ever dealt with.  Instead of using thumb screws, you have to use a wrench (cheap one included) to adjust the tilt.  It is much more difficult to get the TV held in place and tighten this way.* Similar to the above, the mount gives the ability to adjust leveling after it has been installed.  This is also done with a wrench, but it is a big pain and is very difficult to keep level (keeps slipping) even with a helper.* Lastly, be aware that when folded completely, the screen is not centered over the wall mount.  It is about 2-3&#34; to the left or right, depending on which way you fold the arms.  If you're looking for the flexibility of full motion but most of the time it will be against the wall, keep this in mind.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2014", "summary": "No flexibility for 600x400 VESA pattern, Slips Easily"}

I've been able to easy index various contributors and articles and save them for later.The quality of the scans aren't great. In some cases there are water stains or scribbles on the pages. It's possible that was the best they had, since let's face it I doubt Hugh Hefner and company were thinking of posterity early on in the magazine's run. Printing in particularly is pretty disappointing. At the very least it would have been nice to include the option to read transcribed text like Zinio and other software offers. That said, on a computer screen everything should be fairly readable.As others have mentioned, the quality of the pictures is also an issue. In fact I was really shocked to find out this 250gb harddrive has 215gb free. You'd think with all that space they'd scan these documents in a higher resolution, or at least offer some extras like separate folders with high-rez shots of Playmates. It seems like a lost opportunity which Playboy may be kicking themselves for now. When I inquired via email on the 1960's DVD box set they immediately offered me a [...] off coupon for this set, which would indicate it isn't selling as well as they had hoped.Which is kind of sad, because for all it's faults there is a goldmine of intellectual property on this hard drive. The articles, pictures, even advertisements are great to read.

After Bondi Digital put out the great Rolling Stone magazine compendium and the first edition of the Playboy decade series (the 50's and now the 60's), it was time to get to digitizing the whole collection. Playboy is the perfect subject for the Bondi treatment on so many levels - culturally, politically, aesthetically and yes even the advertising! (we love seeing ads from the 60's for things like the AMC's Javelin car, Hai Karate aftershave and a full set of Jack Nicklaus golf clubs for $199!)It's all there, every issue from Hef's famed Marilyn Monroe debut cover to Joanna Krupa's final cover of the first decade of the new millennium. One is stuck by many things, the calibre of the photography, the nature of the political times, decades of interviews (from all the legends you know, Norman Mailer to Woody Allen, Salman Rushdie to Bill Maher), even the print quality (a bit dot-screened in the early days to a much glossier look today.) Not to mention, of course, decades of beautiful babes from Anna Nicole to Pamela Anderson and virtually every Hollywood starlet of the last half century.The main thing, of course, is the functionality which through the digital domain allows the reader (viewer?) to browse every title by cover, date and decade, search for specific content (we read it for the articles, remember?) and view pages in full screen, double page and multiple levels of zoom formats. There are advanced search tools to even pare down your search across multiple parameters. One drawback: in keyword search you will be taken to the page of the word but the search term is not highlighted and your computer's `find' function may not work as well (at least on the Mac version we tested.) One nice feature is that the system supposedly allows you to create reading lists so you can add articles to a list for future reference and even export the list as well, (though we weren't quite sure how you get that feature to work and found nothing mentioning it in the documentation.)If there is a negative, it is perhaps that technology has advanced past the original CD-ROM curve that this series is based on. With the touchscreen, page-flip world of today (iPad, Kindle) and the shift towards cloud computing, it is only a matter of time before a new version of these compilations are expected by consumers. With this content already now digitized, it seem that such an item should be coming down the pike in the not-too-distant future.

Bondi had assured me before purchase that indeed, the drive's Playboy content could be backed-up onto another hard drive at any time, so that's a relief.

The covers are scanned into the Bondi files as separate files, and the Bondi viewer assembles them into each issue.

Note that there is no option to do years or decades...it's one issue at a time, baby....and that would be more than a bit time consuming.I've returned mine, and received confirmation of the refund within 48 hours of them receiving the drive.Coulda been a contender...but no cigar.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2011", "summary": "Playboy should be embarrassed."}

This was a combined Birthday & Father's Day gift, allowing me to comment on the full item.This installs with no problem, I chose to uninstall the version I had first.They improved the search engine; I am finding articles that I could not find with the original engine.Quality of each page is very good to excellent. However, two-page items have alignment problems. The two sides are not meeting smoothly. This seems to be a production problem and is NOT in the electronic ZENO copy of the magazines.Other than the above items, my review is still valid.*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************I have Playboy Cover to Cover for the 50s and the 60s. This item is on my wish list and will be a 2011 gift. While not being able to comment on this item, I can comment on the quality of the oldest magazines and BONDI support.Cover to Cover is just that! Think of an electronic copy complete with inserts, as it existed when published. The quality is never less than a VERY GOOD quality print edition and most are EXCELLENT quality. I have never been unable to read something or found a bad picture.Bondi is the software system that allows you to \"read\" the magazines. Searching is not a major problem. Simple searches produce very good results. Do a search for Grahan Wilson or a playmate and the returned information is excellent. Try looking for a dimly remembered story and returns may not be very good. I have no more problems using the Bondi reader than I have with the reader for the New Yorker or National Geographic and the search results are compatible. I have had the Playboy 50s through two PCs and the change from Windows to VISTA. Bondi supported their reader with a download that installed with no problems. The Playboy 60s had an updated version that installed over the old one without problems. Bondi has more than Playboy under their system. If that is your reason for not buying, you cannot buy any product like this.Playboy is an American icon and a record of the good life for 60 years. The magazines are a trip down memory lane, the fiction is still great, the cartoons are still funny and the women are beautiful.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2010", "summary": "Enjoyable look at how we were"}

Both are bargains when purchased at the discounted price Barnes & Noble provides to its members.However, they are designed for reading...if you want a gaming tablet, a Skype video tablet, or need access to thousands of apps, you need an I-Pad.I have owned a \"Brand X\" color e-reader for about a year, but seldom use it for reading because it causes eye strain. I have a Nook Simple Touch e-reader that is wonderful for books, but its e-ink screen is black on white only, which does not work well for colorful magazines such as \"Automobile\" or \"National Geographic\".Barnes & Noble has an offer that enables its members to buy the Nook tablet for MUCH less than the price quoted by internet vendors, so I took advantage of their offer...plus the staff of my neighborhood Barnes & Noble were very helpful, and invited me to classes they provide to teach new owners the in's and out's of their new tablet. Mine is the 8gb version, which works as well as the 16gb version. I added a 32gb memory card, so my Nook has more storage for books than I could ever fill.The Nook Tablet is the best of both worlds. It is easy on the eyes for long reading sessions because its screen was designed to prevent eye strain. The fonts are very clear, very sharp, and have very high contrast, enabling you to read with the screen set at a very low brightness level, eliminating eye strain. Independent tests have verified that the Nook tablet has less reflection and glare than any color e-reader or color tablet, because the screen's glass cover is bonded directly to the LCD, eliminated the air gap that causes glare.The vivid color makes magazines \"pop\" even more than their paper versions. Barnes & Noble adds a special \"text only\" option for magazine articles that make it easy to read the text by enlarging the fonts and putting the text of the article in a single long file.The Nook \"shop\" does not work as well as the Nook website on the internet for searching for specific books or categories of books. So, I downloaded the Dolphin HD browser from the Nook shop and use it to look at the Nook shop's book inventory. The Dolphin browser uses tabs, so I can put two or three books I am considering in their own tab, and switch back and forth.The Nook Tablet has Pandora Radio installed, so I can listen to my favorite music while I read books. The sound is weak through the Nook tablet's puny speaker, but wonderful through good earbuds. I also transferred about fifty of my favorite CD's to the Nook's memory card, so I can listen to music even when I am not near an internet connection.When I get tired of reading, the Nook tablet lets me watch movies and tv shows on Netflix or TV.Com. Movies on Netflix look wonderful, because the color balance on the Nook tablet is superior to that of any seven inch tablet currently available. Skin tones are difficult to get \"right\", but the Nook tablet does a great job.Many reviewers make the error of comparing the Nook Tablet to full-blown tablets, such as the Apple I-Pad. The Nook Tablet is designed to be an e-reader, and for that purpose, it is superior to any of its seven inch competition. The fact that it includes Pandora Radio and Netflix is a bonus...but it IS an e-reader. The Nook Shop has a relatively small number of apps, each of which has been tested to verify it works well with the Nook tablet's seven inch screen...most Android apps are designed for a three inch or four inch screen.The reading apps for children are impressive. Last week I downloaded a free children's book that combined the best of the \"book world\" and the \"video world\". The book played music in the background...as a character walked through a field, the flowers were swaying in the wind. The book provided an option to have a character read the book out loud, and an option to turn the voice off, so your child can read the book to herself. Many of the children's reading apps are free, or cost less than $5, a bargain compared with the $15 or $20 children's books sell for in stores.The Nook website offers a \"book of the day\" for adults and a \"book of the day\" for children. The illustrations in the children's books take advantage of the Nook's color screen. Yesterday's children's book was \"Mary Poppins\", a bargain for $2...but the REAL Mary Poppins seems a bit scary compared with the Julie Andrew's Disney version.For people who want MORE than just the world's best e-reader, Amazon.com sells a $35 SD card that converts the Nook Tablet into a conventional Android tablet with full access to Google Play and its vast array of Android apps. Just put the N2A card into the Nook's card slot, and restart the Nook. When you want to use it as just an e-reader, take the N2A card back out. Best of both worlds...the best seven inch color e-reader becomes a very good seven inch Android tablet.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "05 3, 2012", "summary": "The BEST Color E-Reader - With Bonus Features"}

I did a lot of research and put a lot of thought into it, almost buying him a kindle fire because I thought it was more \"manly\" looking. After much consideration and comparison of hardware, I opted to get this one. The big selling point for me the fact that it can boot from the SD card. I have seen the N2A (Nook2Android) SD cards here on Amazon and wanted him to have that functionality but didn't want to pay that much for one, so I did some googling and figured out how to make one myself. I purchased a 16GB micro SD card and in about an hour and a half, had the thing booting to CM7 from the SD card, and now it has full tablet functionality. It runs AWESOME, super smooth and very responsive, full tablet capabilities including running 3rd party apps and access to the google play store, and all without rooting or voiding the warranty. All he has to do to put it back to stock is remove the SD card (which he never does! It is pretty much useless in its stock form unless you only do light web browsing and read ebooks) My husband LOVES it and couldn't be happier with it. He uses it every day. The only thing it doesn't have that I consider a negative is a camera. MY tablet (Acer Picasso) has a camera and I do actually use it quite a bit, but my husband says he wouldn't use one  on a tablet so it doesn't bother him anyway. He also dowloaded Kingsoft Office and now uses this for work as well.

My brief encounter with the actual tablet exceeded my initial expectations. However, I was told the great point of difference about the Nook versus other tablets was the customer service. Unfortunately, after having my Nook less than 24 hours, I learned of several issues. I reached out to customer service. I started with chat. After being fed automated responses that didn't answer my questions, the chat session abruptly ended after 1 hour for no reason at all. I then sent my questions via email. I was again met with automated responses. Sixteen days later and they still haven't answered any of my questions. I then called. I was told to seek out my answer via the web because they were experiencing too many calls. I opted to wait. Guess how long the wait was? About 30 seconds. This deemed promising. However, the person who took the call didn't seem to know much about the product. I finally conceded and asked to return the product. I followed their very detailed guidelines on returning a product. However, the product (which was sent via certified mail and signed for at the appropriate destination which they do not dispute) seems to have been lost in space. I have yet to receive a refund. And, after multiple phone calls, chat, tweets, emails, etc. I imagine my only recourse at this point will be to file something with the Better Business Bureau. For those who live within 5-minutes of a Barnes and Noble, perhaps the Nook is the way to go. Overall, the tablet worked great if you recognize the memory it touts is really limited to Barnes and Noble stuff and the amount of proprietary gunk they have on the tablet limits you from using it as a true tablet. Basically, it is a hyped up version of an e-reader for those who only want to shop Barnes and Noble. This is ok, as long as you know that's what you are getting. But, for anyone who wants customer service and can't make it to a store regularly, don't count on any support. Don't count on anyone being helpful. Don't count on anyone doing anything other than sending you automated responses that may or may not address your issue. This is really too bad. But it is honest. I rarely complain about a product. But, when a company is this incompetent one must be honest. And, when a company touts that the number one point of difference is customer service and the service is this horrific, well I think that speaks for itself.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "12 14, 2011", "summary": "Tablet Fine.

As a result, what you get is pretty limited.It's a fairly sturdy device by feel, and not difficult to hold for a while and use. The quality of the screen is pretty good and it's not difficult to read for extended periods of time (so long as you're not out in the sun anyway, almost all LCD screens perform poorly there).Very little of the space on the device is available for sideloaded content by default, so you need to use microsd cards to add more if you want to do too much with that.You can sideload content from any source that uses Adobe DRM for epubs, and also epubs that don't have DRM at all. This means that getting ebooks from the library is pretty simple. You can install an Overdrive app and do it directly without going through a computer if your library uses overdrive.You can root it to get access to more apps. If you want to run a more pure version of Android, you can go for either putting together a Cyanogenmod card yourself or purchase one already made from Nook2Android.B&N; gives away a book and an app every Friday on their blog, so that's worth checking in on regularly.On the whole, this is an okay device for reading and can be a kind of nice semi-tablet to give to someone who normally tends to load their computers/tablets up with viruses by being carelessness. It's locked-down state works in your favor from that perspective.For more general tablet use, this is a pretty poor choice. Also, as of mid-2013 the later devices (Nook HD/HD+) have been radically marked down, so if you're going to buy one of these you should look to get it pretty cheap.

I've been wanting an eBook reader for quite awhile, so I was really excited when it arrived by FedEx this morning.I'm a disabled American Veteran, and on a very limited income, so I receive a small allowance each month for my personal items. I had to save for several months in order to purchase an e-book reader. I did a lot of Internet searches, reading, and comparing features before choosing the \"Nook\". I also based my choice on past experiences with Barnes & Noble (book stores). I never expected them to \"ROB\" me as they did.I bought the Nook with my own money, and it is mine. Shame on you B&N; for stealing from a loyal (ex) customer. I trusted you and you stole from me.If any of you are thinking about a Nook, \"Be YE Forewarned\", B&N; has a nasty little bit of firmware just waiting for you, on the Internet. This little thief will lock up your Nook so you will only be able to download books and apps from Barnes & Noble.You will buy only the things they sell and you will pay their prices. There are so many free apps and ebooks available, but you will not be allowed to have them, if you purchase a Nook. If I had it in my power, I would have everyone to buy some other brand and teach the \"Big Guys\" a lesson on how to treat people.

I hate to sound like I'm pissed off, but I am pissed off.With all the nice features, the Nook would be a great piece of technology, were it not for the stinking little virus waiting for you out there in Cyber land.Tom MullisPS: For those of you who know how, you can do this thing called, \"rooting\", but there are many of us who are not able to do this procedure. And I'm pretty sure Barnes & Noble will soon write a piece of software that will take the Nook back, and prevent you from doing it again. The folks at B&N; are not dumb, they will figure it out. They are not dumb, but they are crooks, willing to cheat and steal for that, \"almighty doller\". So beware.By the way, are there any lawyers out there willing to take on a \"class action\" suit?

It is advertised as being an Android tablet, and it is.  The only problem is that it is an older, custom version of Android 2.x that was modified by Barnes and Noble.Faults:-Android Market (Now known as Google Play): It does not come with the Android Market installed.  Instead, you are stuck using the Barnes and Noble market.  When I first checked out the market, I was hoping to find Angry Birds.  I did...I had to pay $4.99 if I wanted the game.-Wi-Fi:  At times, it would disconnect and not reconnect.  When I let the device scan for wireless signals, I would get a blank menu.  The only way to fix it was to restart.-Side loading: You can install Android Packages using Side Loading.  The downfall is that you have to find the APK on the internet which can be very difficult.  If you happen to have an Android phone, you can download the package on your phone using the market.  Then make a backup using Titanium Backup to Side Load onto the Nook.-Crashing: The tablet will sometimes freeze, crash, and restart.  It can happen very often and it gets very annoying.-Charging: You must use the cable and power adapter supplied in order to charge the tablet.-Camera: There is no camera.-GPS: No GPS.Pros:-MicroSD: It does have a slot for the MicroSD, which most tablets do not have.-Hardware: The hardware was powerful and worth the price compared to most of the tablets out at the time.-Battery: On the average, the battery would last 8-9 hours when playing simple games, reading books, or listening to music.-Hackable: You can easily hack the device to install Google Play or even a modified version of Android.I would only buy this product if you can and plan to install Cyanogen 10.1 (A modified version of Android 4.2.2).  It is more stable than the version of Android installed on the tablet.  The only downfall to using it is that it lags from time to time and uses the power in the battery a bit faster than the stock Android.If you do not know what I am talking about, visit XDA Developers forums.

I really don't read a lot of e-books or e-magazines, but when I do read them on the Nook Tablet, it's a nice experience, but I still prefer physical books and magazines.  It plays MP3s and up to 1080p videos just fine, but like I mentioned, I'm not a fan of having to plug the device into my PC to sideload content or load media onto a memory card (though it's really nice that the Nook has a micro SD slot).  If you're looking for a device for web-browsing, Netflix-watching, and Scrabble (pretty much the only game that I want play on it), then this is a great device.  B&N is still at a disadvantage with a pretty limited app selection compared to Google Play and Amazon's app store and of course Apple's App Store, but after being enamored with my work phone (iPhone 4) for about six months, I'm over the apps and much happier with the Nook Tablet's larger screen, with the 1 GHz processor and 1 GB of RAM, there's plenty of power for my casual web browsing and video watching at home.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "05 14, 2012", "summary": "Great device for web browsing, Netflix, and Flash video.

I am used to hard copy books and not ebooks. In fact I dislike reading ebooks on computer having tried a few times. Regardless I purchased this Nook tablet for reading and found it to be enjoyable and have read and finished a few books though I only owned it for about a week. It's comfortable in your hand though you'll have to find the right balance for yourself. Also, it is easy to use since I'm bad with technology and has smooth and fast reactions, as well as easy to turn the page.Reading however was not my only objective, if it was the ereader would be great too and much cheaper but I wanted to use this as an organizer, entertainment, and just for mundane things. The Netflix, browsing, and games are great. The volume is a little low but putting on headphones solves the problem or a quiet area. Organizers are fine as long as you find the right app.The batteries however are lacking in my opinion since I use it to read or entertainment for long periods of time I have to charge the battery daily or at maximum in two days. I think I watched something on Netflix for about 20 minutes and drained almost 5% on my batteries or a little less than that. Another troublesome thing is that at times the browser or app I'm using force closes. Though it doesn't happen too often I get irritated easily. Also, the screen smudges very easily you would probably want to get a screen protector for that if nothing else.Conclusion.Great product without the apple price.Suggestions.Don't purchase the cover or anti-glare from Barnes and Noble store it's really expensive and Amazon is cheaper.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2011", "summary": "Great product without the extraordinary price"}

Chaika \"book, movie, tech lover\"", "helpful": [17, 19], "unixReviewTime": 1329350400, "reviewText": "Months later, I am still happy with this Tablet, but you should know 2 things. One is, you'll get it for $224 if you're a B&N; member.  Also, if you go online, often they have a deal such that if you buy a year's subscription to the NY Times, they reduce the price of the Tablet.  To get the member's discount, you're better off going to a B&N; store.  BUT THE BIG THING is, if you already own Kindle books, Barnes and Noble stupidly don't provide a Kindle app, HOWEVER, you can buy the cheapest n2a card, either on Amazon or on n2a.com.  This allows you to boot your Tablet up as a full Android tablet (like the $500 ones), and you can get the Kindle app on that.  There's no problem accessing your Kindle books on the Nook.  Since, as noted below, the Nook eReader is beautifully designed, much better in my opinion than any Kindle, so I use my n2a card only when I'm reading a Kindle book.  I find B%N and Amazon charge about the same for books. There are some books on Nook that Kindle doesn't have, and some on Kindle that Nook doesn't have.  However, only Nook has the Page Perfect editions and the Enhanced editions of books with embedded video, audio clips, and animations.One other thing: the Nook has a tab for \"My Stuff\" so you can download music, pictures, videos and documents easily onto the Nook. You don't have to buy music for it.  Use what's on your PC or what you rip from disk. I am doing a project of editing and making slide shows of over 4,000 pictures.  For that, I bought a 32 disk san drive for the Nook to download the pictures to and to work on them using a Nook app.  I don't know how you could do that on the 8 gig Fire. I don't know if you can put pictures on the Cloud for the Fire.  However, I can make many different slide shows and digital albums on the Nook Tablet without any Cloud.I got this and the Kindle Fire on November 16, 2012.  Then came days of comparing them side by side.  You can see my review of the Fire on its page's customer reviews, so, how about the Nook?  First of all, if you want one, get it from Barnes and Noble. It cost $199 with a year's subscription to the NY Times.  Even without that discount, it costs $249 with free shipping (and, this month the NOOKcolor Tablet is only $149!)Hands down, for the money there is no finer Tablet than this Nook.  Some reviewers say they're going to get a Sony or a Galaxy for their features. I have no quarrel with that, but you pay for those features.  Sony and Galaxy are fine tablets--I've tried them out, too.  However, the Sony is on sale for $399.99 this month, and the 32 bit is on sale for $499.99.  Comparing it side by side with the Nook, the Sony salesperson said, \"Wow! it's as good as the Sony!\"  Yes, and for about the half the price.Another salesman lamented that the Sony doesn't have the Netflix app, which comes with the Nook. Of course, Sony wants you to buy their movies.  Barnes & Noble just wants you to buy their books, which is fine for a Bookaholic like me.  B&N; has 2,500,000 titles available, over 1,000,000 free.  Since they have a lot of earlier editions of books, Book Freaks like me can purchase those or get them free.  They even have a Page Perfect series which are facsimiles of beautifully designed books. What you see on your screen is what a reader in 1867 or 2007 saw, brilliantly illustrated and unusually printed books.  You'd pay a fortune for them in their original editions, not $3.99. Many children's classics are in this series, but also adult books, like Butterflies.The Nook also has Enhanced Editions with audio and video clips embedded in the text.  Some of the old books are also Enhanced.  Changes because of misprints or other errors in the original are underlined.  You touch them, and can see what the original had. One of my Nook Books is a collection of Kafka.  You touch underlined passages and up pops a picture of the street Kafka has mentioned, or of a notable person he's alluded to.  In general, eBooks are superior to paper if they are on a Tablet with access to the Web.  You read in more depth, and can envision what the author is writing about without interrupting your reading experience. The Nook's connection to the Web is as fast as your wifi and is accessible with two clicks: Look up and Google (or Wikipedia).The Nook comes with Pandora and you can also download music from your computer using the USB cord which comes with the Nook.  Pictures, videos and documents can all be downloaded to the Nook, which has built-in folders for each, and, if the 16 Gig iof the Tablet is  not enough for you, you  can put a 32 Gig or smaller SD card.That's not all!  If you're App happy, you  can buy the N2A card for the Nook Tablet, which gives you every App in the Android Marketplace without rooting it and voiding the warranty.  I myself have been happy so far with the thousand or more apps available for the Nook, with new ones being added each week.  Truthfully, if it's apps that are what you want most in a tablet, the way to go is the iPad--for $600-$700 at the least.I gave my granddaughter a Nook Tablet.  Many of her friends have iPads; however, she says, she can get the same apps as her friends do. Using the Drawing app, she designed her birthday party invites on her Nook and then emailed them also using her Nook eMail.  She says she prefers Angry Birds on the Nook.  I can't comment. Angry Birds don't tempt me, but I do play some games on my  Nook.The Nooks have no cameras or Face Time, but with the money you save by buying the Nook, you can get an iPhone which does  have both.  If you want features like that in a Tablet, it costs $500 or more plus monthly data fees. No data fees with the Nook, of course, although you can browse the Web with ease and speed, depending on your router.You can stream movies and TV stories with ease on the Nook.  The picture quality is excellent if your wifi is.  I'm in a rural area with no 4G, but I still get crisp, clear movies with my wifi device.  Apps standard on the Nook are Hulu, Smithsonian, Showtime, and Netflix.  There may be more sources of flicks on it, but, truthfully, I haven't looked--and, since they add apps every week, you have to keep looking.If, like me, your primary use for a Tablet is reading, the Nook is tops.  Their eReader is elegantly designed and beautifully intuitive.  It even tells you how many pages are left in the chapter you'e on.  Notice, it displays page numbers, not \"locations\" like the Fire.  If you can't remember  who a character is, put your finger lightly on the name. 5 popups show instantly.  Touch Find, and in a second you have a page which lists every page that word has been on, complete with it sentence. (You can do this with place names as well.)  The other choices are Highlight, Note, Share, Look Up.  The Share lets you highlight a passage and send it to your Contacts--not social networking sites.  For those, you use the Share option in the menu at the bottom of the screen.  My friends tell me they love getting these passages from me.  Of course, I choose those  that are witty or relevant to a discussion we've had.  Other reading options are Go to Page, Back, Find (for when you want to type in the search screen), Contents, Text options, Brightness and Discover.  This last shows you other books on the subject you're reading about or by the same author.In short, as an eReader, the Nook is tops. As a Tablet, it does well, although not as well as those that are way more expensive.  Actually, everything it does do, it does very well.  It just doesn't have certain features--but that is true of every Tablet I've seen except the iPad.  As of now, the iPad's picture quality is not as good as the Nook's or, for that matter, the Fire's.  The iPad3 will have hi def, however.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "02 16, 2012", "summary": "Outstanding 7\" Tablet"}

Yesterday, I call customer service, and they were helpful until they sent me to some barely English speaking person to help me. I supposedly fall under warranty, they wouldn't help me until I was able to plug the device into a USB port I didn't have one available to me. So after 15 minutes I had absolutely no luck. Today after another 13 minute conversation with someone else who because of the language barrier thought I was asking him to reset my password instead of send me another usb cord(?????) he told me that I should call back in 5 days because they're out of stock on cables. I may get it in the mail though, but in 5 days if I don't, call back and check on it. I got no confirmation number, no confirmation email, nothing. I mentioned that I do use this thing daily.

It does the jobs well until now. I personally like it very much for its excellent hardware performance. With low price, fast response, and light weight, book size, and Barn and Nobles support, It is the best device for children when you want to have something as an alternative for your computer.I am a fan of Amazon.com and meant to buy a kindle for my children. but the displayed sample on my local Bestbuy store showed me that the nook tablet responded much faster than kindle fire. It could not be generally true, but based on the displayed tablets, I had to choose the nook.Until now, I have had mainly happy experiences with it. It has apps for children, one of them has many Smithsonian videos that my small children love the most. My college age child also use it to check email at home because it responds in second to wake up, and we do not have to turn it off for many days before it runs slow. After you turn it off and restart it (hold the power button for seconds for on and off), it become fast again.I just found last day it has a recipe App with more than 17,000 recipes. It has pictures for most of the products.My children have asked me to buy the istory app for 3.99 dollars, but it contends 24 or more story books for children that it reads to my children. Wonderful! The American history app is excellent too, It costs me 1 dollar or so (not remember exactly now).Problems: It did start after my children left it idled for hours while a game was running. After the battery was charged for a whole night, it still refused to start. When I tried again in the afternoon, it started but took more than 10 minutes. I guess the software was damaged and repaired. It is now as good as it was before. I am still wondering what was wrong with it.It is not a computer and can not be connected to TV. only one or two of my children can use it in the same time. We still have to use computers when we want to enjoy movies or photos together.It was designed for you to buy their books. but I think the prices of most books are not low enough for me to purchase e version. I would rather buy some hard copies instead. However, one of my children loves the classical books which are free or only one dollar each. She is happy with the books.As a summary, the machine is excellent, sturdy, fast, and convenient for emails and web browsing. The books are not priced low enough for me to purchase although there are some old free books. Apps for children are wonderful.

Haab", "helpful": [5, 5], "unixReviewTime": 1325635200, "reviewText": "I pulled the trigger on three of these on pre-order back in November.  I'd cancelled my order for as many Kindle Fires because I felt the technical specs justified the extra $50 for the Nook Tablet.  I also appreciated more onboard storage and expandability since we're a four person family and I drive ... all three were for my wife and kids and not me, and I expected they'd be used on the road a lot.I think that by the time anyone reads this they should know that the tablets (both Kindle and Nook, to be fair) are tied to their respective distributors.  That didn't come as any surprise to me, I fully expected it.  I knew that, without modifying the device (not really acceptable for your average person, if you ask me), I would be stuck with B&N;'s app store.  What I didn't know was how woefully limited that app store really is; it pales in comparison to Amazon's and doesn't even register when compared to the android marketplace.My daughter got hers first (a late birthday present).  For the most part, she was satisfied with it.  I made sure wifi was available throughout the house; we downloaded a couple of apps (Angry Birds, of course, and a drawing program).  The first thing to notice is that the B&N; app store has a tiny selection of free apps.  The ad-sponsored version of Angry Birds can't be found, but for a couple of bucks I didn't mind paying - I paid for the non-ad version for my phone, too.Netflix works as well on the tablet as it does on any other device in my home (PS3 and a bluray player, both hardwired networking) as long as wifi connection is good.  Her other use was email, and since she hardly gets any, the built in app was OK.The other two tablets I purchased were for Christmas for my wife and son, and that's where the problems started.  My wife gets copious amounts of email from several different accounts and likes to keep it as neat as possible... she also uses her smartphone and computer and doesn't want to have to delete things three times.  The built in email application absolutely sucks.  You can't even empty the trash to completely delete messages you don't want.  We experienced this on our phones and installed the highest rated email app we could find on the android marketplace, which also happened to be a FREE app.  B&N; makes nothing by distributing free apps in their marketplace, so this app was not available at all, and the selection was slim for other apps.  Even the touchpad app that people were using to syncronize with Microsoft Exchange servers apparently doesn't work (and is very expensive for an app).As I mentioned, I knew I'd be limited to B&N; app store - I just didn't realize how limited that app store was.My wife then started getting a bunch of free samples of books, and bought several of them.  They all downloaded except one stubborn one.  That book would load just fine on all the other Nooks in our house (the other two Tablets and we have two original Nooks, as well).  I sent an email to technical support and received the usual \"we got your request and will reply as soon as possible\" message, along with the addition that they are experiencing a high volume of help requests.  That was a week ago and we still have not heard back.  After a few days, though, we physically took the Nook to the store to get help.  Nothing worked; off/on, archive/unarchive, even de and re-registered the device (losing our wifi and email configs in the process).  This book still will not load.We finally \"side loaded\" the book, which required installing a program on my wife's PC (which is very annoying in itself) and we were required to create an Adobe ID (how much spam will we get from them, I wonder?).  After side-loading the book, it has no cover art... more annoyance.  That book still won't download correctly, even after they told us it'd be fixed in 48 hours (that was five days ago).I am not one to \"root\" products like these (especially since they aren't \"mine,\" as I won't be the one using them).  As the \"guy,\" it seems I'm responsible for all technical support in the house and didn't want to deal with the ramifications (or, frankly, even take the time to run through all those steps to do it).  It's not that I can't, it's that it's a pain in the buttocks and I simply shouldn't have to.  We were not asking for the world, we were asking for a table that had Nook e-reader software and allowed a few other niceties.  I wasn't expecting an iPad for $250, but I was expecting working software and a functional email program.It's technically not a bad tablet - the screen is bright and clear and responsive; the UI is decent (although I prefer the four buttons on my android phone over the single big \"n\" button on the Nook).  It's solidly built and sturdy; with Angry Birds and Netflix as my only benchmarks I can say they both run much better than they do on my phone, with no pauses (that I saw) in Angry Birds at all.However, the accumulation of annoyances was a bit too much for me (let's say there was a nagging voice coming from somewhere... the other side of the bed).  I am returning all three - luckily B&N; has a holiday policy that will allow me to return them, which is very cool of them.  They have not lost me as a customer; I have my books purchased from them and will continue to buy.I hope them the best in the future; it was a nice try.  If they just weren't so tight fisted about control over content (especially apps, in this case) I'd have stuck with it.  Technically speaking, the device is quite good and, at the current time, IMO, the hardware is worth the price tag.  I wouldn't mind being limited to the B&N; app store if they actually offered more apps... a LOT more, as they have practically nothing compared to what's available for the android community at large.  Again, I'm not asking for an iPad; I know the iPad can do some really cools things this Tablet can't, just something to make the \"tablet\" part of the Nook Tablet more worthwhile.I imagine they'll fix glitches with the download problem, too.  I'm not the only person who had a problem, but I think everyone else managed to find a solution (besides side-loading).  Keep in mind I generally know what I'm doing and tried everything, and the \"expert\" at the brick-and-mortar store couldn't fix it, either.  The lady from Glee didn't come out and entertain us while they fixed our tablet, either... that was disappointing.So that's my review - it's decent hardware hamstrung by a few bugs and tight fisted control over content.  Some will argue that it's not meant to be a tablet, it's meant to be an e-reader, but let's be honest - it's marketed as a tablet; it's called the Nook TABLET.  It doesn't have to be an iPad, but it should work a lot better than it does at being a tablet.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2012", "summary": "People shouldn't be surprised about what it is, but still disappointing."}

The people at Walmart didn't want you near them, and didn't know ANYTHING about them. Best Buy was pretty much the same, except you could 'sorta' test them out. BN though had people trained to know EVERYTHING about them, even the stuff that was not listed about them on the BN website.First thing not listed: if the Nook Colour can do it, so can the Nook Tablet. (for instance... read .cbz files without installing any extra apps)The 16gb model was much more responsive than the 8gb, so to me it was well worth the extra 50 bucks.Add to that that currently if you buy one at BN and don't like it, you have 2 weeks to return it for a full refund as long as it is still in new condition (so no attempting to root the device, which from what the rep told me will brick it unlike the Colour)that pretty much sold me, I found a place with micro SD cards on sale, bought a few, and took my Nook home.Pros:The screen is AWESOME! I use it for reading .cbz comics and .pdf files more than anything. The missing gap between the glass and screen made reading much better. Also the response on the touch screen was great.much better response time at turning pages, launching apps and using the inet that other tablets in the budget rangenative flash supportnative .cbz support (main reason I bought it)supports almost every popular ebook format except for .mobi (which can be converted to epub or .pdf anyway)good size for holding one handed for reading and lightweight (under a pound)battery life... 11 hours+ with wifi off, 8+ with it on, I tried it out and watched lots of movies and did some reading on it without it coming close to dying on me.a test drive opportunity if you buy it at BN and dont scratch it up or anything. I like the idea that I was able to take it home and so if it actually does everything that I want it to do wihtout a fear that I'm stuck with it for good.also if you buy it from BN you can buy an 'oops' return warranty (which means if you spill coffee on it or drop it, it can be replaced)affordable if you go without things like eating out 2x a week for awhileCons:lack of Android Market, lack of some apps I would like to see on the BN market (such as Google Music app) no sideloading apps at the moment either. That being said, this also means that apps available from BN will actually work with your Nook, there isnt a quantity over quality in the app store either. This means that if you've bought an app from Android market, you will have to buy it again if you want to use it on the Nook.The screen. trust me, I love it. But unlike other tablets where if you crack the glass you just have to replace the glass, on the Nook if you crack it, the screen is toastno front facing camera (or any camera for that matter). The ability to use Skype would have been nice, but wasn't a complete necessity. I've had many friends with tablets that had a camera that swear they never used it even once, and thinking about it, I wuld seldom use it either since most places outsite of my house that I will use it are places where video chatting would be frowned on, like Starbucks or the libraryno bluetooth, which to me didn't matter, but it seems to be an issue for some people. There IS bluetooth, but it's disabled and there isn't a way to enable itno GPS, this would be nice, unlike bluetooth, I would actually use it.mono speaker instead of stereo, again seems to be an issue for other people, I plug it into the minijack on my surround sound at home or the jack in my car stereo when I'm on the road though and its just fine. I use headphones if I'm out and about. Why on earth would I care about speakers that I never use anyway?no .flac support. a good chunk of my digital music now is .flac. it does have .ogg support thoughno .avi support. again, a massive portion of my movies etc are all in .avi format. It does have .mkv and .mp4 support though, so from here on out I will just have to rip my video files in those formats if I plan on watching them on it.lack of decent accessories selection. lets face it, the case market seems to be geared toward people that worship at the church of Steve, and the availability of accessories shows it.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2012", "summary": "GREAT .cbz (comic file) reader an more!"}

I downloaded some of my pdf files, checked my email, got on the web, and got a couple of reading materials from the Nook store....then I looked at the apps selection of the B&N store -- jeeze, very limited.  I had read multiple enthusiastic reviews talking about downloading third party apps, went online and was very happy to download several of the same apps I use on my smart phone that are not available on the B&N store.  I got a few apps, sideloaded them, and was happy.  At this point I would say I would have given 4.5 stars if I reviewed it right then and even told my friends and patients the same.  Then I turned on my NT right before Christmas, and the third party app capability had disappeared.  I discovered that the 1.4.1 firmware update that was pushed to us unsuspecting users had disabled the capability of third party apps.  Talk about disappointed -- The main reasons I got the NT (instead of a Kindle Fire) were #1 the android OS that allows you to run literally thousands of apps, and #2 the memory card expansion slot.  Now, with third party apps locked out, the NT in my eyes has significantly lost value, in fact it really isn't much more than an eReader now -- and I could have spent a lot less and got either a black/white version or nook color if an eReader is all I wanted.  It was marketed as a \"Nook Tablet\" and that is what I expected when I bought it.  Now I am really thinking hard about taking it back.  Nook \"tablet\" my foot - without decent apps, this thing is basically a nook color that costs a lot more.  This is a totally bone headed move on B&N's part, and very draconian.  I understand that they want users to buy content from them instead of a competitor  -- OK, fine, but how about offering some content in terms of apps that I want or need? What about free apps from other sources that you wouldn't make money on anyway? What about the apps I already paid for via the android store that I use on my smart phone, that I am allowed by their EULA to put on more than 1 device, say my NT plus my smart phone? I would love to put some of those apps on my NT, but either B&N wants me to buy another copy from them now just to use on my Nook, or I am just SOL if they don't have it available in their store.  How many times do I really need to pay for Angry Birds?  Do you think people buy MP3s from iTunes, then turn around and buy the same MP3s from Google, then turn around and buy the same MP3s from Amazon?  Well, then why should B&N insist that you do?  I don't have a huge issue with them steering customers back to them, if they just offered more selection in their app store.  Have a look at the android market - I think they have over 50,000 apps, Look at the Amazon app store -- over 24,000 apps (many free) -- I know that is their competitor, but they need to improve their own selection if they want to keep me as a customer.  They have basically said to their customers you buy from us, or you buy from no one.  You lock people down, you tell them you only buy from one source (B&N) and then offer a pittance when compared to your competition, and even charge for some apps that are free elsewhere, or charge for apps the customer has already bought somewhere else previously, then don't be surprised when customers leave you for other products.  The Nook has superior hardware, but it doesn't mean Jack if you can't have the software you need/want in order to utilize the hardware -- like I said I'll probably take it back to the store.  I'd rather have a Kindle Fire or true android Tablet so that I can use the software I want to use.  And now when my friends and patients ask, I am now telling them to buy something else where you can actually use the software you want - I have totally came around 180 since the B&N \"update\" stripped one of the best capabilities out of the Nook Tablet.

It has so many really irritating quirks and problems.  I've never used any other brand, so I can't compare, but I definitely don't recommend getting a Nook Color.The biggest problem is that the battery life is abysmal.  After just a couple months use, I now only get about 2 hours of use on a full charge, even with the screen dimmed quite a bit.  Since I want to use this when I'm traveling and don't usually have access to an outlet, this is a HUGE problem and extremely limits its usefulness.Besides that:* It has a tendency to turn itself on.  This happens whenever I put in or remove the power plug and sometimes just when it gets jostled.  Sometimes I don't notice because the cover is closed. Turning itself on after I remove the power plug definitely doesn't help with the already abysmal battery power.* When I'm using it while it is plugged in and charging, which is most of the time because of the poor battery, it repeatedly displays the battery charging message, ever 10-20 seconds for a second or so.  This is VERY disruptive when trying to read, forcing me to pause and wait until it disappears.*  While reading, the menu at the bottom pops up A LOT too, for no apparent reason, covering the lower text.* Sometimes books get stuck on one page and won't advance or will skip pages.  It takes quite a bit of finagling to get it to show the missing pages.* There are a few spots on the screen that don't respond to touch, especially near the upper and right edges, which is where webpages usually have critical navigation buttons.* The zoom feature is very hard to use, and the zoom level doesn't stay the same  when moving from page to page, especially on websites. I try to zoom the webpages so I can access buttons under the dead touchscreen spots, but the page won't stay zoomed in when trying to move the page to get to the desired spot.* The touchscreen doesn't work well on webpages, often selecting a different item than the one touched.  This often sends me zinging off to undesired links.* The on-screen keypad doesn't always pop up when trying to type something on a webpage, and there's no way to manually make it show.* The Nook's book filing system is rudimentary and hard to sort.  I would especially like to be able to sort by rating, but it doesn't allow that.  I'd also like to be able to tag books, but can't do that either.* The B&N; online store search is terrible.  You can't do a dual search to narrow down long lists, and it will only list the books alphabetically by title.  On the tiny Nook screen, it takes forever to scroll through long results.  You can't exclude tags.  When I search for mysteries, there's all this paranormal stuff mixed in that I'd like to exclude but can't.* I can't look through my own reviews on the Barnes and Noble website using the Nook Color.  It doesn't support that feature.  I can only access them on my regular laptop.  Dunh.  I read a lot of books and can't keep track of all of them.  It would be handy when I'm thinking about buying a book by an author I've read before to be able to see what I thought of the author's other book.* Some Google apps and Flash Player apps don't work on the Nook.  I subscribe to NFL Game Rewind, something I enjoy when I'm on the road, but I can't watch it on my Nook Color.One thing I do like is that there are a lot of really good, free books for the Nook Color available through the B&N; online store.And I like that I can watch Netflix.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "04 17, 2014", "summary": "abysmal battery life, plus lots of really irritating little problems"}

I previously owned a first generation Nook, but wanted an e-reader that was in color and offered extras such as web browsing and games, etc. I didn't need a device that was a full mini-computer, so the Nook Tablet was perfect for me.I've had my Nook Tablet now for almost a month, having picked it up at a local B&N; store the day it was released. It took only a couple of minutes to set mine up, since I was a previous Nook owner. My husband got one at the same time, his first Nook, but his only required a few more minutes to set up than mine.WHAT I LOVE:1) I am enjoying the full color. While I loved the eInk technology of my old Nook, being able to look at my books and magazines in color is wonderful. The default brightness was a bit much for me, but I was easily able to tone it down to get close to the brightness of the eInk technology, without sacrificing the clarity and color of books, magazines and other apps. The shiny screen hasn't been an issue for me.2) I love the in-store experience, where I can have full access to an e-book for up to an hour a day. When my hour's up, I can decide whether to buy the book, add it to my wishlist for later or just \"check out\" another e-book for another hour. My husband and I have enjoyed having a couple of \"Nook Book\" dates at B&N.;3) Buying books & apps on the Nook Tablet has been easy to do. (All my old purchases from my 1st generation Nook came over without any effort on my part.) I've enjoyed finding cheap reads, like an 81-book collection of public domain classic books for just $3.99. And while it took a little doing, I have set myself up to check out books from my local public library. I am definitely reading more.4) I have also enjoyed buying a couple of games, like Scrabble, Pot Smash and Quell. Lots of fun, even if it cuts into my reading time a bit.5) I have activated Pandora (which came loaded on the Nook Tablet) and am enjoying it. I tried to sideload some music onto my SD card, but the resident music player doesn't work as well as I would like, but Pandora is great. So far, I'm just doing the free service. (BTW, there is an external volume control, unlike the new Kindle Fire.)6) Reading books on the Nook Tablet has been easy to do. I bought a cover which helps to protect my Nook, but also gives me a \"book feel\". Page turning, adjusting font size and look, etc. have been easy to do. I have found it helpful to lock the screen orientation, so the book I'm reading doesn't automatically rotate between portrait and landscape when I shift my sitting position a tad. (FYI, ePub books allow you to adjust fonts, but not PDF books.)7) I've done some Web browsing when I've been in a WiFi area. I never planned to do extensive browsing, so the Tablet works well for me. It's not as good as browsing on a PC or maybe even on a larger tablet like iPad, but it's definitely better than on my cell phone.8) I had a SD card on my old Nook, so all I had to do was swapped it over to my new Tablet. Worked perfectly. I have always kept my personal content (Word Docs, photos, music and PDFs) on my SD card, so the fact that the new Tablet was designed to work this way was fine with me.THINGS I WISH WERE BETTER:1) I can't print from the Nook. The best I can do is open up my book or magazine on my PC through the \"Nook for PC\" app and copy & paste my selection into a Word document for printing.2) I can't organize my music or photos into playlists or slideshow groupings. When you play music or do the slideshow, everything is mixed together. Since starting to use Pandora, the music hasn't been as much of as issue.  (28-Dec-2011 Update: Figured out how to create playlists in the resident music player. Now need to figure out how to group my photos.)3) I wish you could lend out a book more than once under the \"Lend Me\" feature. With a printed book, a book can be lent out more than once. I certainly understand B&N; and the publishers not wanting to have a purchased e-book loaned out too many times, as that represents a potential loss of revenue, but to be only able to lend once for 14 days seems a bit limited.4) I have had mixed results with tech support. I've used both in-store support twice and phone support three times. Sometimes I've gotten great results and other times, not so much. I can say that in all cases, the persons helping me did try really hard to help me and they were very nice..So All in All, I am very happy with my purchase. I can recommend the Nook Tablet to anyone who is looking for an e-reader that offers more than just reading. It may not be a full blown computer like other tablets on the market, but for what it is, it does a great job (especially for the price). The Nook Tablet is the size and weight of a small hardback book, so it feels like a book, but it's much more than a book. It's a whole library of books, magazines, games, etc.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 16, 2011", "summary": "Love my new Nook Tablet"}

If you manage to root this device (voiding your warranty) you still won't have bluetooth, GPS, a camera, HDMI, nor the ability to easily connect your Nook to your monitor, TV, printer, keyboard, or mouse. You will only have internet access when you're near wifi, no option of 3G service.If you're looking for an e-Reader, just buy a regular e-Reader. The reading experience on the Nook is NOT the same as classic e-Readers, which seem to have more of a paper appearance to their screens. Reading on the Nook is just okay and is best in sunlight. I'm not too thrilled about reading on this while in bed, for instance, as it's not as gentle on the eyes when compared to regular eReaders. If you're not used to reading on a regular eReader, this might not be a problem at all for you. If you like the eReader experience, these types of devices will disappoint. While you can change the background color and dim the screen, it is a far inferior reading experience.I, personally, purchased this device believing there would be some setting that would make the reading experience like one on a regular eReader. While the Nook has a lovely screen and beautiful Netflix playback, it's not a good eReader unless you're reading a lot outdoors.I bought this knowing that the app selection was poor, but not realizing just how poor it really is. B&N; seriously needs to open up this device for more learning apps. After my initial disappointment, I just figured I would let my children have my Nook. It *seems* to be great for kids as they can use the various learning tools, and they're more likely to reread books than I am. But, when it came to looking for various math, spelling, and other learning material for my 7 and 10 year old sons, the selection was dismal at best!It's cool to play Angry Birds on a larger screen to the tune of 3 bucks per version... and Drawdle is a huge hit with my boys, but the excitement sort of ends there. The excitement really ended after I paid 2 bucks for a spelling app that isn't even compatible with my device. The way the market is locked down, that shouldn't even be possible! As for Netflix, well... how many places will I have wifi and the time and ability to watch a movie also? At home I can just watch Netflix on the big screen TV. It would be most useful for long car rides if you have mobile hotspot on your phone. But, of course, streaming from your mobile hotspot will just eat up your monthly usage!All in all, I say it's a very confused device. If you're looking to buy this, save yourself the money and just buy the Nook Color for $169. The tablet is a little faster and a little lighter in weight, but $250 sort of exceeds this device's usefulness. I was also planning to read library books on my Nook... only to learn that I don't have access to the Overdrive app in order to do so. If there is some roundabout way to accomplish this, I just haven't put in the time to investigate.I honestly think this device is best suited for kids just because big touch screens are fun. In the end it's an over-sized android phone without the market... or the phone lol. It's a cool toy for a kid (maybe 8-18 years of age) to have for the family on a budget, I guess. But to me, it's starting to feel like a waste of money. I'm not too keen on the reading experience, and while both of my kids are just dying to get time on the Nook, the learning app selection is *severely* limited. However, as my kids aren't as picky as I am, they would actually get some use out of this device as an eReader. Yet, since this doesn't seem to be a device designed for kids, I do wonder how long it will take them to break it. =-p", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "03 20, 2012", "summary": "What are you looking for???"}

One reviewer reported even the B&N; tech person in the store was unable to enable the Nook Tablet to download library eBooks.EBooks cannot be directly downloaded onto the Nook.According to my librarian, B&N; has made this a more complicated process than on the Kindle Fire, needing more steps, but the Overdrive Platform accessed through the library website which uses the \"Adobe Digital Editions\" Application provides the needed interface to bring the library onto the Nook Tablet through your home computer.My county library system has a Downloadable Library that is powered by Overdrive.com.  Overdrive works with thousands of publishers to distribute eBooks to libraries, schools and retail establishments like B&N.;  With the help of the reference librarian at my city library I was able to successfully link to the \"Overdrive\" website through my library's website and then download the \"Adobe Digital Editions\" Application onto my home computer.  The Reference Librarian talked me through parts of the process on the phone. I called twice for help not wanting to tie her up while I went through the registration process.This Application is offered free from Adobe.com but does require registration with Adobe to access and download it.  The library eBook editions are then downloaded and stored on the home computer through the \"Adobe Digital Editions\" Application.  The digital book copy can be transfered from the home computer to as many as 4 other digital devices (Adobe allows for this), but each digital device must be authorized before downloading the very first eBook.This was a long and overly complicated process it seems to me, and it took close to 2 hours for me to complete all the steps and then download a library book through the library's Downloadable Library site to the \"Adobe Digital Editions\" platform on my computer. I finally was able to transfer the eBook from my computer onto the Nook through the Nook Tablet's USB cable connected to my computer. My husband made sure that we safely disconnected the cable from the computer through a pop-up from the task bar before physically separating the Nook Tablet from the cable connection.Through this Adobe application I am able to read the downloaded eBook edition on my computer.  I put an icon on my desktop for quick access the platform. And ... I can read the book on my Nook Tablet as well. Hopefully the next eBook I download from the library will be an easy and swift process since all is now in place for this to occur smoothly and quickly.I have done this once and it worked perfectly, but downloading an 874 page book swallowed 60% of the Nooks 1 GB of memory that is designated for \"My Files\" on the device.  I await the arrival of aSanDisk 32 GB microSDHC Flash Memory Card (card only) SDSDQM-032G.  There isn't a lot more that can be downloaded onto \"My Files\" without it.This is the first device of this sort that we have bought (no cell phone or Ipod or other such devices), so I have few expectations at this point. Downloading library books was of critical importance for me.  I actually like the Nook. I love the Pandora app that comes pre-installed. Beautiful color screen with crisp images. I like that I have web access and can email things I want to read from my main computer to the Nook or download an article from the web and store it in \"My Files\" to read later.I have another week to decide if this is a keeper.  I'll update this review if there is more to say.  I might change my rating then.  Only 3 stars now because of the already known and often discussed limitations, the expensive apps and the overly complicated library download process.Hope this helps.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "02 9, 2012", "summary": "The Nook Tablet does support library downloads, but enabling it was time consuming."}

Their response was to point out that their return policy states that they will not take back electronic products which have been opened. (How else can a buyer find out if it works?) That's a nice gig if you can get it, selling high dollar electronic products with no responsibility whatsoever if they turn out to be worthless junk. Unfortunately, Amazon backed up their claim, based on the \"published\" return policy. In 12 years as a steady Amazon buyer, I've never looked up and read a return policy. It's sad to think that I have to from now on. (When I buy DOA products at my local Radio Shack, they exchange them without batting an eye.)

I've had it 3 days.This thing gets 4 stars as an E Reader (-1 star for being in BN lockdown mode), 3 stars as a TABLET (limited app availability) and 5 stars for being the perfect pre-bedtime Entertainment TV/Reader.My background as a reviewer is I have an android smartphone, a 2010 Compaq laptop with Windows 7 and I'm a lifer as a PC (non-mac) user. Never owned a tablet nor an EReader but I've used the NOOK app on my smartphone (which is amazing BTW). I've perused the previous NOOKS and was very disappointed at the buttons and user interface.  This is a SIGNIFICANT improvement over the previous, with a fast duo-core processor, micro SD expandable, and it claims to have 16 GB on board memory (ONLY 1 GB IS FOR YOUR PC-TRANSFERRED MEDIA: CAUTION!). I don't know yet if the expandable micro SD will give you more space for NON-BARNES AND NOBLE content.  I see this is a major, major, major star deduction in the Quote Unquote.....\"Tablet\" category.  It takes this little gizmo from HERO to almost ZERO for this user. :(  I'll have to get a separate tablet OR return this one.That said, I see advantages to being the \"best\" at only a few things.It's primarily an E reader and Netflix and HULU viewer with Web surfing capability. As someone who was not doing much e-reading on my smartphone or laptop (occasional textbook or a Nook book loaned to me), I am sooo loving that the NOOK Tablet introduced me to the new way convenient way (inexpensively) to save paper, read books, magazines, and newspaper WITHOUT extra clutter.  I am a chronic book purchaser, so having my first E READER may take care of my \"where the heck do I put these books?\" -- problem. BTW, I am loving having my smartphone (Sony X10)sharing of nook books and mags on the go, and my NOOK articles for bedtime reading. Textbooks: lady in the store said textbooks, if they are PDF or PUB files, can be viewed on this here thingy. BUT and this is a big BUT... Mind the ONLY 1 GB OF YOUR OWN MEDIA THING.Ok, this 1GB of memory thing may cause the review to have 1 more star taken off for the dishonesty of the \"16 GB\" claim, and the non-open-source nature of their BNAndroid OS, and 1 star added back -ok, ok- for the really super low price. That keeps the review at 4. :( Hmmph.Netflix + E Reading beautifully + Web + flash playing video + dedicated volume on side + cute little keychain loop (design) = $249.00 (that's not bad!)Having a dedicated E-reader \"plus more\" might just be what I've been looking for.  A laptop is too clunky sometimes.  Inconvenient for pre-bedtime movie streaming. The limitless book seleciton capabilities (I can change selections if I'm bored) is such a nice benefit to having a NOOK.ANDROID:  This seems to be B and N hybrid version of Android OS.This little tablet reader is great because then--it limits how media explosive you're allowed to be.  Sometimes I think that we are \"overwhelmed\" by too many options. This device is great for bedtime ET. don't get a bedroom TV get a nook. But then buy a tablet PC also, for virtual online school and/or work for your MS OFFICE and all that stuff. Very limited app avaiilabilitiy. But for like $4 bucks there is a NOOK office app that, I 've heard, lets you do Office things. (you can read them for free, but to edit: buy the app).So.. If you speak android phone already, you will feel frustrated a bit with limited app avail. (No Google MAPS app, for example). However, you quickly realize that ah ha! It's different from your smart phone, and that's something to love. The netflix app dissipates any bad feelings, alone. Then, the \"flash\" player ability (type in you tube and you stream videos on web,directly - try that on your previous android OS).Even though you can't have amazon, best buy, google reader apps- which I find essential, you can WEB browse these sites. I don't know how to PODCAST upload This american life yet and that's a bummer, but I can just do that on my smart phone.Pros: netflix app, web browsing, great color resolution, access to B and N is convenient. Dedicated volume rocker control, \"expandable\" micro SD \"claims \" to go up to 32 or additional 32 GB but other users have found this to be untenable.Cons: You can forget about 90 percent of the apps you know and love. Only have few nook apps (probably because of this being a B and N android applied OS).CAUTION as ANOTHER reviewer pointed out ONLY 1 GB OF THE ON BOARD MEMORY BELONGS TO YOUR CONTENT: MUSIC, VIDEO, DOCS, WHATEVER. The rest is B and N reserved territory.Music: Does not play WMV files so you'll have to convert them to MP3 before uploading to the NOOK.Sound: onboard speaker is ok.  I really enjoyed the listening experience with headphones, watching favorite TV shows streaming.  The TV / netflix HULU streaming are thus far my favorite features.Plus, and this is a big plus-- I love the reader. Click* and the page turns. Mmmm.  I know E readers aren't new. But the set up was SO EASY.  I don't mind that these are not \"E-ink\" pages because I read sort of slow and - well,- honestly, I guess I'm staring at a laptop in full-color all day anyways. So the Reader is not a problem, to me. I've heard some say if you've an avid page turner, you need to go with the monochrome Nook in B and W. BUY YOUR SCREEN PROTECTOR, HOLDER, AND ACCESSORIES AT AMAZON THEY ARE WAY CHEAPER HERE.I might have to buy a separate Tablet, or, a PC Tablet. For $249 (at B and N stores or online), this thing is a fantastic addition to my home entertainment set-up, organization of books (saves paper and space), and a lightweight little buddy for web surfing on an ample screen.For tablet, I'm thinking of the Samsung Galaxy 10.1, Motorola Xoom, HP TouchPad, Sony S, or even perhaps HP Slate.  It might be nice to have the (Tablet) productivity machine in your life be \"separate\" from your home leisure entertainment device.  The NOOK is that home leisure entertainment compain.  All the while, it is still light enough to sneak around with you.  You may love it so much you'll jealously guard it from the public, and keep it at home for safekeeping, lest you drop it, scratch it, or someone hijacks it from you. And if it does get hi-jacked you can set a password for acessing the NOOK , just like cell phones.

Since then, I have memorized the use of my Nook inside-out, and know all the Pro's and Con's.Pro's1. Very user friendly. Has an easy to use menu button that lets you hop from one place to another on your Nook. You are able to put allot of your personal content on the home screen, making it really easy to get to your favourite apps and books quickly.2. Great storage. The Nook Tablet has 16 GB built in, and the memory is expandable up to 32 GB via a MicroSD[HC] Card. Content stored on card runs pretty fast for a Tablet.3. Best-ever e-book reader. Its nothing that can be fought againsed: Nooks are the best e-readers of all time. You can change the size of the text, background page color and picture settings easy. Has a built-in dictionary that can be used to look up words that you don't understand in that new Hunger games best-seller, or just to look up any random word when reading Pilgrim's Progress. Overall, a great E-Reader.4. Large selection of apps. The Nook store always will have the newest Fruit Ninja app, the new temple Run and much more. ranging from gaming apps to apps that will help your business thrive, the Nook store has it all.Con's1. The processor. Sometimes the Nook will run into reboots that can take up to a minute, though they never actually seem to help the Nook itself. It can't handle that many downloads at once, which can make your downloading of the Angry Birds series.2. Hard to unlock. Unlike allot of other tablets, Barnes & Noble really have this one guarded. It is very hard to hack it (Legally)to get all of the Google Play apps. There's a card that can do that, but it costs $50. So, not the best for the techy-app types.3. Poor speaker. The Nook's speaker isn't the best. Even at full volume it isn't that loud. The only way to really hear anything good is with headphones.So, it seems like there's some for getting it and some for not getting it. But it sure works for me. At least it has a better e-reader than the Kindle Fire.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "09 25, 2013", "summary": "A pretty good Tablet."}

If you have nothing else to do with your money besides hand it over to Barnes & Noble, then go ahead and buy this tablet; you'll love it! Everything-and I mean everything that you want to put on this tablet you must purchase from Barnes & Noble. The first thing that you'll notice is that you are locked out of the Android market, the Google market and the Amazon market for apps, and for e-books. You MUST purchase from Barnes & Noble. Barnes & Noble's apps are overpriced. Barnes & Noble expected me to pay $.99 for a calculator! A calculator?Want to try out a trial version of Angry Birds or any other popular game to see if you like it before you purchase it? Forget it! You can't there are no free trials at Barnes & Noble! There are free trials of business software, but they're very limited and their obvious purpose is to require you to buy the more expensive, full program. For my purposes much of the business software is pretty much useless.E-books. You must purchase your new e-books from Barnes & Noble. I'm working on a Masters thesis the present time. I had purchased the book that had a lot of background information that I needed from Amazon.com. It cost $14.99. The same e-book from Barnes & Noble.com (or NookBook) as they like to call them, was $40.00! That's right, $40.00! I don't know about you but I can't afford such nonsense.I purchased a Barnes and Noble Nook Tablet on 1/6/2012. I used their web site as a research tool. Glowing reviews, promises of 16GB storage capacity and ample access to \"thousands\" of apps had me convinced. However when it arrived I discovered that the 16GB storage was only 1GB for me, and all of the rest for content that I was to be forced to purchase from B&N;! Barnes & Noble completely locked me out of the entire android market. In other words, unless it is purchased from B&N; - YOU AIN'T PUTTING IT ON YOUR TABLET! Come to find out Barnes & Noble offers practically no android apps. The books they offer for free you can get many from the Gutenberg Project web site for free. Lame books! Everything about the Nook is to sell their products to it's owner. Nowhere on Barnes & Noble's website it it detail the types of restrictions that are put up on the purchaser of a Nook Tablet. I believe the Barnes & Noble misrepresented itself. I believe that those restrictions should have been posted in plain view on the homepage of Barnes and Nobles website. But they were not. All I wanted is my money back.They promise a full refund if returned before 14 days:BUT! Don't count on returning it if you don't like it.I purchased a Nook Tablet for $266.43 using a credit card on 1/6/2012I received it on 1/11/2012I called for an RMA # on 1/16/2012I shipped it per their instructions on 1/17/2012They received it on 1/24/2012They told me my $266.43 would be returned by 2/17/2012. It wasn't. Now they say 3/172012. Or maybe the billing cycle after that on 4/17/2012? As a added insult, I have to eat my $17.01 return shipping costs.

No doubt about that!  For viewing movies it's superb!But.....there are a lot of things BN needs to fix --- fast!  Things that the Nook Tablet HAS and this one does NOT!The Setting interfaces in books and video is now so UN-user Friendly that it is irritating.  On the Nook Tablet, which watching a video, if you tapped on the screen, you could easily option the Brightness setting bar.  Not now.1) Never mind.I STAND CORRECTED.  As of 11.30.2012, my Pandora app works.  B&N; must have heard our cries!2) It does not play Flash videos.  Boo!  This is, admittedly, a problem with many tablets out there.  Many websites are getting away from Flash but for now, you can't watch a website that uses Flash.....except with a very untrustworthy app download.3) it freezes sometimes after wake up on books.  You have to sometimes re-start the darn thing.  NOT good!  It'll get stuck when you turn a page, even with the animations off.4) In the Night View, when the Brightness setting is all the way dimmed, (which helps in Power saving) is too dim. NC is much better, still dim but not unreadable.5) The font size in all areas, all apps (settings, email, contacts, Nook Friends, Pandora etc.)  is ridiculously small. It's even smaller than the font size on the NC and Nook Tablet and it's a bigger size item.  And there is no way to make it bigger.  Nice.  Not.As you are reading a book, if you tap on the screen to access the chapters, page slider, font size etc. ---- all of that is way too small and where the heck is the Brightness Slider? Oh, that's right ---- it's not THERE any more!  Who's idiot idea was that?6) when you tap on a word to access the dictionary, it often freezes or is unresponsive.  Then when the dictionary options do come up, and you tap on Look Up, often THAT freezes. Say what? Oh, and when the definition does appear, the font is so small, it's almost unreadable.I normally read my books in a much larger font size and on the NC/NT, the definitions are readable.  Even though this tablet does have Text to Talk, it's not that great and I don't want text to talk, thank you.7) The web browser does freeze often but this was a big problem with the NC/NT  too.8) when watching a movie, you cannot easily access the Brightness bar, and when you try to tap on the Movie slider to advance or go back, that sucker disappears faster than you can ever imagine.  On the NT, that slider stayed for at least a few seconds, enough for your finger to get on it.  Very annoying.  Also, again the Brightness button is not easily accessed.  You have to tap on Settings, go to the Brightness setting, adjust it and then find your movie in the Main Menu and reopen it.9) The keyboard is a joke, as it was on the NC/NT.  Come on, how hard is it to have a \"qwerty\" keyboard with numbers at the top.  All other tablets have that.10) The Brightness button in not on the tool bar when you are in the book reader as it was in versions past.If B&N; had kept all the aspects of the Nook Tablet, adding the gorgeous HD display, the larger, less bulky hard drive, and the more robust processor of the HD+ , the Nook HD+ would be a winner-winner, chicken dinner!Hate to say it but:My husband has the new 10\" ASUS HD tablet and I think that's actually a better buy!  You just download the Nook app, which does allow you to view the magazines as on the older Nook Tablet, by the way. I didn't check if the kids' books work (i.e. read to you).

In real end-user terms that means you get the responsive light touch and quick displays iPad users know so well.

A fat lot of good having my books out on the \"cloud\" when there's no wi-fi around.But here's the best part of all.  You can plug in Micro-SD card that will boot up the Nook into a full Android tablet.

If you are wanting to get an android device where you can go to the market or amazon market do not buy the nook table.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "04 4, 2012", "summary": "Nook Tablet"}

Mediocre tablet that is decent for media consumption but is limited at media creation.  Limited Out-of-the-box functionality because it seems to have been designed to require third-party apps. Total Cost of Ownership is $400.I readily admit I am not the target user Barnes and Noble (B&N;) had in mind for the NOOK Tablet.  I spend a lot of time flying for work and my needs were for a supplement to my laptop. Tablets, including the vaunted iPad, are meant for enjoying media (music, video, casual games, reading) and not for editing or creating new content.  The 7\" tablets are even more hampered by their limited screen space.  So why did I choose a 7\" tablet instead of an iPad or 10\" competitor?  Price.  The large tablets start at $600 and after adding peripherals your Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) is $900 - $1000, which is the same price as a good laptop that does everything...except run on battery for a 6+ hour flight.After a lot of online research, I settled on the NOOK Tablet.  B&N; has a 14-day return policy so I put the Tablet through rigorous functionality testing to determine whether to keep it or not.  As much as possible, I only used the built-in applications and made no changes to the hardware or software.  I will not discuss the hardware because you can find dozens of reviews online.  These are my results.Reading books. Naturally, the Tablet excels.  My concern was that it be able to remember bookmarks on multiple books and PDFs even after powering off and/or removing the SD card.  Verdict: PASSReading magazines.  B&N; tells you up front that you have to cancel your emagazine subscriptions and use their web store.  I tried reading PDF versions and online subscriptions through Zinio's website (which supports everything except NOOKs).  There just is no easy way to read multi-column magazine articles on a 7\" tablet.  This is too bad because my second reason to get a tablet was to stop carrying around 15 pounds of magazines.  Verdict: FAILReading and editing MS Office Documents and PDFs.  This is 70% of my job and the primary reason for purchasing a tablet.  The Tablet has a lite MS Office reader and a PDF reader.  Both are good at reading documents. Neither allow editing or adding notes to documents.  For about $20 you can buy excellent third-party apps that allow editing both types of documents. (Note: Animations in PowerPoint do not animate so the Tablet is not suitable for showing animated presentations.)  The virtual keyboard is the biggest limitation.  Most internal apps do not support rotation so the keyboard is not much wider than a smartphone keyboard.  You have to type with your index fingers to keep from hitting numerous keys.  Where the keyboard totally fails is a lack of cursor keys.  If you have a typo in the middle of word, there is no way to move the cursor to the exact letter you want it on.  Retyping entire words is not uncommon.  Verdict: FAILEmail.  The Tablet has email capabilities and works really well with GMAIL accounts.  However, security is appalling.  Once your enter your account and password you are never prompted for it again.  This means if someone picks up your Tablet they can read your email.  The settings can be changed to require a password to compose email, but it does not appear to work.  Enabling the 4 number passcode on the Tablet is the only security you have.  Because of this, I have not tried connecting to my work MS Exchange server and probably never will.  Verdict: FAILWeb Browsing.  The Tablet has a good web browser that supports Flash Video, which means you can watch YouTube videos.  You can keep bookmarks and open HTML pages stored on the media card. The primary browsing limitations are the screen size (and obviously need for a wireless connection).  Verdict: PASSCalendar and To-Dos.  There are no built-in apps for either of these, which seems unthinkable.  Even a basic smartphone has these.  You can download free ones from the B&N; app store.  Verdict: FAILNote Taking.  No built-in app for writing notes!  The Tablet has a microphone, but you can't even create audio notes.  Note taking is the one killer app I wanted for home use.  I write notes everywhere to the point of being buried by them.  Third-party apps saves the day.  Evernote works great with the Tablet - and supports audio notes and keyboard rotation.  Verdict: FAILMusic.  The music player is absolute garbage and there is currently no third-party alternative.  The first week the music player would skip a lot and even crash the Tablet when playing MP3s from the SD card.  Recovery was horrible because the Tablet wouldn't shut down and then wouldn't power up without being connected to the power cord.  Fortunately, a firmware update solved the instability problem.  Despite four ways of sorting music, finding and playing music in the order you want is terrible (see comments on audiobooks).  You can pause and resume a song but you cannot stop.  There is no stop button.  The speaker on the Tablet is lousy.  My two-year old Blackberry phone has a better speaker and it's 1/3rd the size of the Tablet.  The speaker is very loud though so will fill a hotel room with mediocre sound.  Surprisingly, the speaker sounds no worse even though covered up when the Tablet is in a carrying case.  Verdict: FAILAudiobooks.  You would think an ebook reader would also have good support for audiobooks.  The internal memory and media card have folders for specific media types.  You can even create your own folders on the SD card.  However, no matter where you put your media, the Tablet finds all of it and dumps it into either the music player or the media player.  There is no way to separate audiobooks from music.  Where the music player completely fails is playing audiobooks in sequential order.  Most software applications sort by reading a filename from left to right and sorting on the first character difference it finds.  The music player apparently looks at the first few characters and then the last characters and ignores the middle ones.  For example, an audiobook with multiple discs and chapters should sort by discs first (1, 2, 3) and then by chapter (1,2,3).  Instead the Tablet sorts by placing all the chapter ones together and then all the chapter twos and so one.  The file manager sorts alphabetically so you have to open the media card file manager and play audiobooks from there. Verdict: FAILPictures.  The Tablet is a pretty good electronic photo album with all the pinch-and-zoom features you expect.  However, like the music player, there's no way to segregate pictures into albums.  I loaded a document with a ton of embedded images and they ended up in the media gallery as well.  You can delete images from the gallery...except the sample pictures for some reason. Verdict: PASS (but hoping for a feature update or third-party alternative soon)Video.  NetFlix and Hulu work good over a wireless connection, but you may get lower resolutions due to the bandwidth limits of a wireless connection.  Playing stored video files requires using the media player. Even though the web browser supports Flash video, the media player does not.  As long as you convert your videos to .m4v format, you can put anything on the Tablet (Handbrake or RealPlayer is perfect for converting video on a PC/Mac).  The image quality is great, although I seem to notice a slight flicker in converted Flash videos like they are playing at 28 frames per second rather than 30.  The media player does not support scene selection/jumping to chapters in movies and has no bookmarking feature.  Unlike the music player which will play in the background, you cannot multitask.  If you leave the media player to use another app, your video will stop.  Unfortunately, videos get lumped into the media gallery with photos and the thumbnail appears to be a random still image from 1 minute into the video.  Verdict: PASS (it's a book reader, not a movie player)Total Cost of Ownership.  Currently, the Tablet costs $250.  For something designed to be used on the road, you will need an extra power supply ($25) and protective cover case ($35).  The $50 extended warranty is a requirement since the Tablet will probably be dropped and crushed frequently.  To install more than a few books, documents, and media files will require an SD card ($20 - $35).  Add another $30 to purchase third-party apps to add functionality and you have around $400 invested in the Tablet.  Purchasing ebooks and emagazines is an optional ongoing expense.Final Verdict.  As much as I tried to only use built-in apps during the trial period, when I could not get the functionality I wanted from them I was able to download a number of free or inexpensive apps.  These allow me to do the basic content creation and editing I need on the road. A B&N; employee flat out admitted the Tablet was rushed out the door with only NOOK Color functionality so was not being fully exploited yet.  The firmware update proved B&N; is committed to making the Tablet live up to its promise. Realizing that no tablet can yet replace a laptop, and the functionality and ubiquity Evernote brings, convinced me to keep the Tablet.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2012", "summary": "Good ebook reader.

I didn't need the GPS and cameras that are 'missing'. The 7\" form factor turned out to be ideal for my purposes.The selection of eBooks from Barnes & Noble is excellent and even the magazines I bought are more than readable. Netflix video quality, while not High Definition, is certainly High Quality and is simply stunning with the right movie and since I am a Netflix streaming subscriber already, was 'free' to me. So far so good.Here's the rub. The selection of apps from B&N; is truly pitiful. I mean, worse than you can imagine. Now combine this with the fact that the standard email client as installed on the NT is very basic and limited and the standard web browser is little better. There are no replacements in the app store. None. What you see is what you get.And something else makes it even worse. You can't add your Google accounts in order to sync with Google services such as contacts, calendar, reader etc.The sad thing is the hardware is MORE THAN capable of running all these services but is being prevented from doing so by the B&N; tablet software and their 'walled garden' approach - similar to that adopted by Apple but without their huge app store and connected services to create the illusion that you are not in an ecosystem prison.There were originally two ways that NT owners could enhance the tablet but B&N; are now attempting to close both of these paths with their latest operating system 'upgrade' (version 1.4.1) that is automatically installed on your Nook Tablet when you connect to the internet. They issued this 'bug fix' release on December 23rd. Bah humbug is right.1. 'Sideloading' of applications was possible on version 1.4.0 and this let you install applications from sources other than B&N;'s paltry selection. So, for instance, you could install Dolphin Browser for tabbed web browsing and gesture input or Skitmail for a real email experience. Now that's all gone and you get no option to add apps that B&N; don't have - which is most of them.  My guess is that for most users, sideloading would have resolved the issue of the inadequate B&N; app store. had they been smart, B&N; would have delayed implementing the blocking until they could dramatically increase their selection of apps.2. 'Rooting' the tablet is a way to bypass the B&N; controls and open up the tablet to the full Android experience which not only means access to the Google market and Google apps but also to 'superuser'  functions to enable enhanced control of the operating system. This is not for novices and requires some technical understanding of the Android operating system so likely only a very small number of advanced users would ever attempt this. B&N; have attempted to block this too. Really? What exactly is the point B&N;?So, what we have here is a truly excellent piece of hardware with a fantastic eReader infrastructure capable of doing so much more than it is permitted to do by Barnes & Noble. Their motivation is to force users to buy only from them - which as Apple have proved - is perfectly okay if you make the selection big enough. Problem is, the selection is totally, hopelessly, unbelievably inadequate. Barnes & Noble will still have a huge hit on it's hands because many people have relatively simple needs. The pity is it could have been a massive home run in their battle to stay alive in the space they compete for with Amazon.So what to do? With a heavy heart I will likely return my gorgeous Nook Tablet and spend just a little more for a real 7\" tablet upon which I will install a Nook app and be very happy. I simply don't have the time, patience or inclination to fight a company that has proven it just doesn't 'get it'.Know what you are getting into before you buy.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2011", "summary": "Superb hardware crippled by restrictive software"}

You can buy or create yourself a sd card with a custom ROM on it. Doing this lets you bypass the BN OS because the nook looks at the sd card first when booting up, it also keeps the nook OS stock and BN can do all the firmware updates they want to do without affecting the SD Card ROM.  With a custom ROM you can install apps or read ebooks not offered by BN i. e. kindle books.

I downloaded some of my pdf files, setup my email (disappointed with the very limited email app), got on the web (another disappointment - very basic), and then I looked at the apps selection of the B&N; store. Where's the beef? An Android device and only a few limited apps available? But then I found an option that was available to download third party apps, which made everything ok, since there are so many available online.A couple days later I discovered that an automatic update had disabled the capability of third party apps. I was beyond disappointed, now I was getting angry. An Android OS should allow you to run thousands of apps! But not with Barnes & Noble's greedy palms! The Nook became \"their\" tablet, and not mine. It was now restricted to only \"their\" apps and downloads. Period.*IF* they (B&N;) were to offer tons of apps & downloads for little or nothing, that would be acceptable. Read some of the other reviews - you'll find that the tablet is nothing more than a B&N; display device now, not a true tablet. You can't even share apps or music that was purchased for another Android device. The ONLY way you can use it for free is by viewing the supported files you can copy from your computer to the Nook (documents, pictures, songs). And if any of those files are large, it struggles to display them.There are over 50,000 Android apps available online, but none of those are available to Nook users.Since this is no longer a true Android tablet that I can use the software I want to use it has lost all it's appeal. Better to get a 'real' tablet than this device. Pass the word around. And there's no chance B&N; will change things now; they don't care.We are extremely displeased and cannot recommend this tablet to others.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "05 23, 2012", "summary": "Extremely Disappointed"}

The newer version is faster, has a higher resolution screen, is lighter despite same screen size, and has bluetooth. (Still no camera or GPS). B&N; also is now allowing access to the Google Play Store. It is available on the newer version but I don't know if they updated the software for this one to allow access. I suspect they didn't but this would be something to check on if considering purchasing.If you want a tablet for web browsing, checking email, ebooks, video, and many other apps and this is as much as you want to spend, then it isn't a bad deal. I would recommend paying more for the newer version--the Nook HD. (They also make a version with a larger screen, the HD+)Also note that there are third party programs available which will allow you to boot a rooted Android system off of an SD card. This will give more options but I found the original Nook Tablet to be sluggish running off such a card--possibly because I also went to Jelly Bean and this might have been too much for the older tablet.

For example, youtube: one can get on youtube from the web browser, but it lacks the usability of an app on a tablet device.  Skype is another.  I contacted support and was told that the tablet did not support skype because \"it doesn't have a built in camera.\"I understand that this is a new product and much is still being developed, but the Nook has a long way to go before it has the range and depth to fully satisfy.

I've had all the Kindles and all the Nooks and for the best overall reading experience the Nook is better.Why? The Nook devices feel great to hold. The plastics are soft, all the buttons are in good places, and recharging takes no time at all. Also, the software layout and navigation is easy and logical. Next, the font choices, sizes, and other personalizations are all useful. And finally, no freaking ads. You can personalize your home screen and on the Nook Touch you can select your own photos for the screen saver.What's my problem then with Kindle? Couple things. The ads of course. Also, I personally don't care for the software. You are stuck in their software with no way to personalize it. Boring! Also, the buttons are in bad places so you can accidentally shut the device off. On the lower priced Kindles the font choices are fewer and the smaller size choices are useless unless you use a magnifying glass. And the devices aren't as nice to hold. At least on the Fires they took the idea from Nook on making the backs have a soft plastic.I'm pretty sure that anyone who takes the time to try both Nook and Kindle will like the Nook better.

I've got to say, it's nice.  Fonts are small, though one could choose dpi if they had visual issues (google this).  Netflix works, and the UI is really quite nice - pretty much no need for Button Savior, battery life is same as CM7.  In general I like it better than CM7.  My major hardware dislikes are headphone jack requires a little wiggling sometimes, no BT, no GPS.  Seems to charge fine with a normal cable.At this point I lean toward Samsung tablets - I like the IR and the microSD slot.===========================Update Jul 2012: I've installed Cyanogen 7, which works with button savior.  I had trouble installing from .zip booting into recovery but was able to install without a hitch using a bootable microSD card.  Fonts are sometimes a bit big, as is line spacing, but in general, CM7 frees you of the B&N; walled-ness, even as somewhat mitigated below.  Netflix doesn't work, and Google Chrome won't run on Android 2.3.  Headphone jack a bit intermittent - need to wiggle wire sometimes.===========================Original review, Dec. 2011.===========================First I give a summary, followed by the details if U are interested.  I hope people will read reviews here, as, if you say much at all on B&N;'s site, they don't post your review and don't allow you to modify it so that U can post it!:A Nook Tablet could be quite good if you only want to:-  Read ebooks purchased from B&N;-  Browse the web on a tablet-  Play a small selection of games, having to pay 3-4X normal Android/Apple pricesGet something else or modify it if U want to:-  Buy a full selection of games/apps-  Pay the same price for a game as U would on an iPhone/iPad, Android Phone buying from either the Android Marketplace or Amazon App Store.-  Play music where U can sort by artist, album, genre, etc.-  Play mpeg videos-  Watch YouTubeIf U are willing to do a bit of work, you can do all this by modifying the device.  I used it rooted with the modifications described below for 11 months, before installing Cyanogen 7.2 on it.  This is a huge improvement over rooted with the below modifications - it's essentially a normal 7\" Android tablet now.The Details:============My daughter got a Nook Tablet for Christmas 2011.  She'd been saving for an iPad (~$500) but at the rate she was saving, we took pity after a year and a half.While she does read (and so do us parents), she also wanted to use it as a music player, and a movie watching device while away from wireless in the car, on a plane, etc, and she wanted to play some games.I did my reading and we seriously considered an iPad for the family with each of our 2 kids putting in $150 or so.I read about the Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet - the Fire only had 8GB of onboard storage at the time, and no micro SD slot.  A deal-breaker.  This was pre Samsung GalaxyTab, Nexus, etc.  Since the Nook Tablet has 16GB and a micro SD slot, we went to a store to take a look.  Sales guy was good, and the device hardware shows well.  Once we got it home and were doing more reading about setup, we found the first of our issues:Issue #1: Onboard Memory========================Of the 16GB of storage, you can only place your own items in 1GB.  The rest is for B&N-purchased; content.  1GB is not enough for a music collection, or any significant amount of video.  A 32GB Class 4 micro-SD card was also in her stocking, having read about this ahead of time.Once she unwrapped it and we set it up (easy enough), annoyance #2 showed itself:Issue #2: App prices and quantity=================================2 Examples: Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja.-  BN Market: $2.99, $3.95.-  Amazon's Android Market: $0.99 (ad-free), with free ad-supported versions available-  Android Market, $0.99 for either, plus free, ad-supported versions available.-  Apple App Store, $0.99 and $0.99, plus free, ad-supported versions available.YouTube: free/pre-installed on all Android/Apple phones/tablets I know of, not available on the Nook Tablet, not in the Nook store.I didn't buy either game, but instead looked back to some of my pre-Christmas reading - U can load Amazon's Appstore without rooting the device, esp. if it's running v1.4.0 of the software.  I got that working and bought $0.99 ad-free Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds.  While I was at it, I side-loaded a few other apps by e-mailing them to myself and web-browsing to get them, and got usb drivers working on an XP laptop so I could sideload via adb over usb.I wasn't home for Christmas, but I did have my work laptop which has music on it.  I copied some over and began to use the music player....Issue #3: Built-in Music Player Limitations===========================================The built-in music player in Android is decent - has been since Android 1.5 - the first version I used.  U can, generally, sort by artist, album, etc, and the UI has dark backgrounds rather than white.  The Nook built-in music player doesn't allow sort. For this, I didn't want to buy a music player, so I went ahead and rooted the device and installed Honeycomb's (Android 3.0's) music player, which is free.  Also put the standard Android YouTube app on since I could now access the Android Market.  The problem wasn't quite solved, because changes to the SD card (adding files) weren't recognized.  I tried Winamp, Songbird and Android 4.0's music player when ICS came out.  They had the same issue.  TTPod does work - you can manually refresh at any time.  I now run Cyanogen, whose music player (modified stock android to add gesture support) works just fine.  They were aware of tablets when they wrote it.This is ironic - B&N; had to do actual work to make it much worse than using the normal android version, plus they had nice opportunities to improve on the experience of a phone due to the large screen - Cyanogen 7 Android supports gestures for music - do an arrow to the left like \"&lt;\", say, and it'll go back a track.  This would be great while driving.(Note that U can unroot by putting a copy of 1.4.0 on an SD card which, though I'm not sure, would probably allow you to return the device if U needed to).Issue #4: Built-in Video Player Limitations===========================================I'd also brought on my work laptop half a dozen videos I nabbed from our TiVos from which I stripped the commercials, saving them as mpg videos.  These wouldn't play with the built-in player.I solved this with MX Player, free version, which plays them fine. U can do this only if U've installed Amazon's App Store or rooted and can access the Android Market. People out there are selling PC software to convert videos to a format Nook Tablet can use. No need - just get another video player.  MX Player Tip: brightness control is an up/down swipe on the left hand side of the screen, volume on the right.Issue #5: UI Inflexibility==========================U can't add shortcuts to the desktop, and can't do much with the sliding apple-style bar either.  For this, I installed App Manager (tough to find a .apk to sideload using adb, so I needed rooting and then got it from Android Market).  This is a fantastic app and I don't use my GoLauncher screen much any more.Also, there's one physical button.  Standard android buttons such as menu (right-click) and back aren't always around in the UI, and holding home doesn't bring up a list of open applications as it does in carrier or stock android.  They should have put those standard 2 buttons on the device.  Update after a month rooted: use Button Savior, which gives soft buttons with a flyout.  Once in a while, you have to use NT Hidden Settings to check USB Debugging unless you use Cyanogen.  Update post Cyanogen: CM7 can have soft buttons (back, menu, home, etc) displayed all the time, if desired, and has Button Savior installed as well.Issue #6: Can only charge with their charger/cable==================================================Nothing more to say.  BlackBerries and Android phones in the house all can charge in the car or at all the computers by just connecting a cable.  It charge very slowly, even if it doesn't tell you it is, when connected to a PC because or other charger.  With some irony, B&N; has had to mail me both a charger and a cable this year due to breakage.  If they could charge with any micro-USB cable, they wouldn't have to.  Update post-Cyanogen: With Cyanogen, it charges with any micro-USB cable, though slowly unless it's the actual Nook stuff - there must be something in hardware.Issue #7: OTA update breaks all the niceness I've achieved==========================================================An OTA update, v1.4.1, will break the ability to mail yourself .apks to be used to enable non-BN apps to install and to enable debugging.  I imagine U could have done these steps while on 1.4.0 and gotten sideloading via PC/adb to work, but U can't disable OTA updates.  U can if you root, though, so I did, then used SQLite to modify a setting to only update when done manually. It'll never auto-update.  Update post-Cyanogen: irrelevant now.Goodness #1: Hardware is pretty sweet=====================================Snappy, installs apps fine, opens them quickly, videos are fairly smooth, scrolling is pretty good (but not as nice as Apple's).Screen is great from angles, clear and bright.It's lightweight and can be held easily in one hand.Speaker is pretty loud - louder than any of our phones except maybe BlackBerry.Goodness #2: the Reading Aspect===============================The reading end of the device is well-implemented, though I give Amazon's original Kindle and all subsequent ones and advantage - an order of a book on an original kindle appeared on the device in less time than it took me to back out of the purchase UI.  Doing so from the web is also very fast.  A web order using a computer of a B&N; sample appeared about an hour later, but quite snappily when done from the device.Goodness #3: Books with Videos/Sound====================================Yes, these are available on Kindle Fire and iPads. I know. I do like the talking kid's books (reminds me of a LeapFrog Tag pen, but without the ability to touch words and hear them), and the free cookbook sample had a video of making a chocolate sauce.  This is good for cooking!  U can see what each stage is supposed to look like.Goodness #4: Good if U Root it, for $250========================================When rooted, it's a nice tablet + it has the B&N; connection, and it cost $250.  It isn't an iPad (no cameras or BT), and it's half the price.  Update Nov 2012: There are now a multitude of 7\" tablets (ASUS, Samsung, Google) which get my recommendation.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2012", "summary": "Very Limited Unless You Modify It"}

The availability of different sized type on the reader devices is very welcome.  I use the tablet, not only for reading, but to watch Netflix movies while on my exercise bike.  The Nook tablet works okay for that, but the larger display of the HD+ seemed that it would be an improvement.  However, there are several problems with the current edition:There needed to be at least one more font size at the high-end.  I had to choose between too small and too large.The sound level was too low, even with headphones.  I could not find a Barnes and Noble application to provide better control over the volume.  There are a number of third-party applications which used to work on the Nook tablet that are now locked out by the current OS version.So, in spite of the beautiful display, I reluctantly returned the HD+ to my local store.

I love bookstores and libraries and hate that they are fast becoming obsolete.Well, B&N;, in its disregard and disrespect for its customers and short-sightedness AND crew of sub-par designers is certainly hastening its demise!  Because they turn a deaf ear to consumers, and have no clue what matters to us, they are cutting their own throats.SOME SPECIFICS:1. Unlike the Kindle, it is virtually impossible to get library books on to the Nook.  I've jumped through hoops, bent over backward so far it feels like my spine will break, and spent HOURS, yes, HOURS going through the BS and I STILL can't read a library book on this @#$@#$ device!  And, no, I don't want to purchase every single book I want to read!  Particularly not at B&N;'s prices.  Amazon's books are far far far far far more reasonably priced.  For that matter, so are Sony's.  And I love and support libraries, though they, too, are sadly becoming a thing of the past.  Its too bad B&N; can't be more supportive of them.  Kindle is...2.  B&N; offers a pathetically small number of real gaming apps~all of them overpriced!!! Most of them boring, stupid and outdated.  Amazon has virtually an unlimited number of apps, nearly all of the cheaper than Nook and virtually every popular game that exists.  Most Android apps can be easily downloaded to the Kindle.  Not so with Nook.3.  Games that you can purchase from external sources like Popcap cannot be downloaded to Nook, but are easily loaded on to the Kindle.Those are just the few things that infuriate me the most (well, other than the fact that B&N; seems to have hired its idiot upper management team from the idiots over at Netflix).Finally, speaking of idiots... I feel like one for choosing to care about a store that doesn't care about me.  I should have figured out sooner that I made a mistake and taken the Nook Tablet right back and purchased Amazon's device.  Don't YOU be an idiot.  The Kindle Fire is the best device.  No question about it.  B&N; has designed this !@#!@# tablet so it won't accept apps other than its own so when it (inevitably) goes out of business, those of us who are STUCK with this soon-to-be obsolete device will end up having to purchase the Kindle anyway.

Preferred over the Kindle Fire because of the Micro SD Card port. The B&N; Nook Store, unfortunately, is quite small; lacking the apps available on the Google Play store. It's dual-core 1 GHz processor is more than enough to plow through any game I've been able to throw at it. The 1 GB of RAM is also more than enough to handle anything. The battery life is also very good, lasting all day even if I play some graphics intensive games. I've never had it die on me. The bezel around the screen is one of the few issues with this amazing tablet, it tends to collect dust around the corners and if you're a bit OCD like me, that will bug the crap out of you. Also, rooting is really the only way to unlock this tablets true potential. Thankfully there are many very easy options out there if you don't know what you're doing. If you don't want to risk anything, creating a bootable MicroSD card with Cyanogenmod 7 on it makes this tablet unstoppable. There's also active development on the XDA-Forum with Cyanogenmod 10 which, as-of-right-now, runs very smoothly with infrequent issues. I bought the device shortly before the Nexus 7 was announced, with the intent of using it for testing my apps that I'm developing (I knew I would have to root it). I really regret not waiting a few more weeks to get the Nexus 7, as it is more powerful (not that it matters) and better for developers (being Google's official tablet). I have yet to get the ADB drivers to work on my computer, there seems to be an issue where it installs drivers for a USB Mass Storage device on Windows 7.Overall, an amazing tablet. Great battery life, more power than most people will ever need, the Micro SD card port is the best part over other tablets in the same market (Nexus 7, Kindle Fire, iPad Mini, etc.).

Later I got an excellent deal on a Tablet & GOD I LOVE IT (now to get a custom skin & cover &lt;3)!!! Originally I bought it mainly because of the e-reader part, but I use it for all sorts of things, & I also take huge advantage of any nearby WiFi.I love that the e-reader part has all kinds of size & font settings & you can adjust screen brightness to your needs. In my case mine is set to white letters with gray/black background & max brightness. Everything is very bright & easy to see & read. I also like the fact that, in the long run, I read a lot so hopefully this saves a few trees :). Granted not every book I want is currently purchasable in E-book form, but there already quite a few books (OK at least 1 or 2 hundred :P ) in my Wishlist. Purchases are easy & I like the double check feature because im the queen of accidental touch screen tapping :). Plus since I do animal rescue & am on a low LOW budget usually there are quite a few good free books as well & an app you can download that helps you find some good free, low cost, & top pick books :).WiFi & otherwise im still getting used to some websites having phone app settings, which ill admit im not all that fond of, but other than that I couldnt be happier! Pages are also easy to see & manage, though a few times Ive overloaded the poor thing which has required a force close :(. Pretty sure thats my bad though. This also happened twice in e-reader mode. I tap too many things at once too fast.In general I wasnt using mine too much at first because I was terrified that Id drop it & or ruin the screen. Since then Ive bought screen covers & use it a LOT more :P. Settings are easy to work with & even the pictures ive added to the \"My Media\" folder are bright & clear. I take online classes, & since most of my tests are multiple choice I find test taking easier & faster on my NOOK. My only complaint overall is that I use some of those pics as wallpaper & since they need to be stretched out for the home page it makes them blurry up close/enlarged. I dont mind that much though. Ive gotten used to it, & not all of the pics turn out blurry if set as wallpaper. Overall I am BEYOND satisfied with my NOOK Tablet, & I HIGHLY recommend it!

Each day, there is a \"Book of the Day\" for $2 or $3...many of them best-sellers or classic books.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 10, 2013", "summary": "Best Color E-Reader"}

Recentley i purchased a tablet and really enjoyed that you could read books with a backlight and in color, beacause of that i went on the hunt for a color ebook. Now when Barnes and Noble started to come out with their ebooks I did not like them, I didnt like the desgin, when i would mess with them at Barnes and Nobel they just seemed redundant and to annoying to work with.  So When the Nook HD came out i researched and fell in love, I am soo happy i made this purchase.  I did not buy it from amazon as my local Kmart had it for 199.00 and you were able to put it in lay-a-way.  Some of the features this product needed to have were expandable memory, and screen functions to turn down backlight and make font bigger when needed. The screen resolution on this item in really nice, the touch screen is super responsive and the quality of the reading and easyness of use makes this an everyone can use product.  It is called a tablet and can be used that way, as you can get on the internet, access email, and also watch netflix if you choose but i wanted a color ebook not a smaller tablet so i really cant tell you how well it works as a tablet. I can tell you if you are looking for a good color Ereader this is the one i would recomend, like i said it is easy to use litteraly two pushes to open a book or access library page flipping is easy and controlls to make fonts larger or smaller, change paper color, even change font appearence are easy.  Also Barnes and Noble stores books on the cloud network for you when you take them off of you shelf. Magazines are interactive, and picture books for children are vibrant and enjoyable.  You can add up to 32gb of extra memory in micro miny memory card slot and the battery i have found if you turn off wifi can last you up to 2-3 weeks.  My sony lasted me about 1-2 months on a single charge so the two to three weeks is not that bad for me.  My 5y/o nephew can work this ebook very easily without help or instruction so like i said it is very versitile.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2013", "summary": "Love the Nook HD"}

I decided it was time to upgrade my original Nook and went with this tablet. I purchased mine direct from B&N. This is a fantastic ereader with a few tablet functions. I really like the interface on this ereader more so than the Kindle Fire. Don't get me wrong, the Kindle Fire is a very nice device, but I like the personal touch I can give the Nook HD. It's more customizable.I can create my own wallpaper and customize my home screen. The ereader is very light and easy to hold with a contoured, grippy back. The screen resolution is fantastic! Even small print is readable. The colors in magazines is exceptional and the scrapbook feature is an innovative touch. I really appreciate having a physical home button, and external volume rockers & power button. The interface is very user friendly and aesthetically pleasing. Setting up email was a snap and customizing my security settings from lock screen passwords to shopping passwords is much appreciated. Web browsing is very zippy on this device. More zippy than the Kindle Fire. Ereading is also a pleasure, with customizable fonts & backgrounds. I was surprised at how well I was able to read on it outside in the shade. It still has a lot of glare, but it is much more readable than the Ipad or the Kindle Fire.I can't see the Ipad or Kindle Fire screen at all outside with all the glare. Nook HD is NOT as readable as an eink screen, so I will be keeping my original Nook of 3 years for outdoor reading. But for a tablet ereader, I was really surprised at how well it did outside in the shade. I have since given my husband the Ipad 2, as I like the 7\" form factor of the ereader/tablet devices. I take them with me everywhere. If you were to ask me which I liked better, the Kindle Fire or the Nook HD...well...I wouldn't be able to choose. Amazon has a larger store for books, apps, movies etc....but I like B&N's Nook HD for it's interface, superb screen and customizable home screen. It also has expandable memory, and you can sideload epub books. I also like the look of the Nook HD better. It would come down to personal preference and which store you have the most investment with. All in all, the Nook HD is a great device that hasn't gotten the attention it deserves, and is worth serious consideration.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "02 18, 2013", "summary": "Great little device!"}

It is NOT a tablet, it's a reader. If you want a true tablet, just spend the extra $100 and get the iPad Mini.We got this around Christmas time, thinking it would be a great tablet for the whole family to use. We were so wrong.While the display is crisp, everything else sucks and it is not user friendly at all. I can't understand why some people gave this thing high ratings - the only explanation would be that they have never held an Apple product in their hands...For start, the browser is the most frustrating browser out there - terrible. Even those we installed were terrible. It keeps freezing all the time and everything takes forever.Then the sensitivity of the touch screen is awful which will make you want to pull your hair out while using the browser, not even comparable to the browser sensitivity and intelligence on iPhones and iPads, not even close!The profiles don't work - we set 3 profiles - one for me, one for my husband and one for our son who is 2.5. One would think that in my profile I will see my stuff. Wrong! Once I go to my profile after my husband had been using the tablet, open the browser - I don't see my tabs, I see all of my husband's tabs he was just viewing like NFL stuff and all my tabs from when I used it are gone. My twitter account is gone - I see my husband's twitter so I manually have to sign him out and then sign myself in... What's the point of the profiles when they simply do not work!?!?And the apps, of course, cannot be compared to those available at the Apple Store. It's a joke! Tiny selection of kids movies and kids apps and the kids apps are so poorly made and so terrible, my son was not interested at all. I had to show him so many times how to use them yet he still struggled and was not interested. He'd rather play with the apps on my iPhone and I didn't even show him how to use them. Apple is just so intuitive and so easy to use.There's no Facebook app (maybe they added it by now - I hope!), no Pinterest app, no Etsy app, no eBay app, no PayPal app... I can go on and on and on...And then of course, this thing doesn't have a camera. It kills me when I see commercials for Kindles and Nooks and they have their tablet next to the iPad Mini and say that everything on these tablets is the same, except for the price. Yes, the iPad Mini costs an extra $100, but it has a camera so you can make pictures and videos and skype on it. It also has a lot more apps and a bigger screen! (almost 8\"). So there you go, spend that extra $100 and get the iPad Mini, you get what you pay for. Unless, of course, you want to use your Nook HD just for reading books and watching movies because that's exactly what Nook HD is - a reader & a movie viewer.One more thing - B&N; customer service sucks!

The screen resolution was great, but the Android OS IceCream Sandwich was slow, cumbersome and basically not well thought out + the speaker volume was really low coupled with Adobe reader being super slow and note taking in Adobe Reader was also painful often causing the app to lock up or freeze, so I was extremely disappointed with the purchase that I made last fall at B&N; for $175. So, I started comparing the Nook to Nexus 7\" and thought what the heck - sell it and buy a used Nexus on Ebay -But, I came across some articles talking about ROOTED Nooks and the possibility of having them go to a full Android tablet, but this too sounded complicated, and after all, I just wanted to use my device like my wife's Ipad Mini - Well after doing a little more research found this website N2A which had Jellybean OS 4.1.2 for download $19.99 - I paid for that - and thought wow what a nice difference for my NOOK HD, Now moving forward several months - I thought, I was going to keep it at 4.1.2, but my BlueTooth only worked so, so and the Wifi was not as snappy as I wanted it to be - Once again I decided what the heck, so as of this early week, I took the plunge and moved it to Android 4.2.2 for $9.99 more on the AFN Website (Android for NOOK, I thought what the heck, 10 bucks more and what can it hurt)...WOW with the 4.2.2 upgrade it is absolutely stellar - I mean it is fantastico - Snappy and fast, honest, and BlueTooth and WiFi are much, much faster with 4.2.2 - AND The Volume, yes the Volume finally is loud enough and I even have to now turn it down - Can you believe it folks, Watching TV, Movies internet Videos are now actually enjoyable - Check out my review for Android for NOOK (AFN) here on Amazon...  and my review for the Minisuite stand and case+keyboard...OH but this is supposed to be a review about the NOOK HD 7\" 16GB, right! Right! -As far as the Nook itself, it is still the best thing out price point wise, Honest,  they are so much cheaper than a lot of Android Tablets, and a lot cheaper then an Ipad Mini or even a used Ipad Mini -The Nook looks great for watching movies, surfing the web, doing my homework reading for grad school, and rivals my wife's Ipad mini any day of the week when it comes to movies on Netflix. Now, I type notes from class on my nook - read, do everything on it -Again much of this can be attributed to Jellybean OS 4.2.2 - I love reading books on my Nook, and I really appreciate the outside cover of the Nook HD (some thought went into this, plastic kinda rubber cover, that works great). I throw this thing everywhere, on the couch, then bounces and hits the floor, it has even dropped out of my hands or off the kitchen counter with no damage at all -Look, I don't need a camera on my tablet - That's not why I bought my nook originally, I bought to watch movies on in bed with the wife and TV episodes on Netflix - I now use it several times a week as a reader and note taker for homework. So, what are you waiting for, go out and buy a nook HD 7\" or 9\" - they are wicked cheap new, and close to Ebay prices, if the ebay thing is not for you - and have some Jellybeans too.Now remember - I can go back to my lame B&N; original OS if I want to, just by taking the micro SD card out , but of course, I won't -Only if BARNES AND NOBLE WOULD UPDATE THEIR NOOKS TO JELLYBEAN 4.2.2 the world would be a much better place. What, the What B&N;!!! Why won't you guys have an update for JellyBean on the NOOK? Why I ask, Why?In the end I might even buy a Nook HD+ on ebay and obviously throw some Jellybeans on that too - because they are so wicked cheap on Ebay right now, and because you have tons of people just simply selling theirs...I hope this helped some current nook owners - and future ones -", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 12, 2013", "summary": "Don't give up on your NOOK HD just yet - make it a Lean Mean Jellybean with OS 4.2.2"}

I had to make multiple calls until I was finally put in touch with someone who could solve the problem of the missing book.One other thing-update seems to have changed screen brightness as before I could read it out by the pool and now I no longer can.In fairness, I will also mention that I have a Kindle paperwhite and an update wiped out my created collections, but didn't lose any books and can still read it out by the pool.Both have Wi-Fi and that may be an inherent problem with updating through it as far as shelves/collections go.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2013", "summary": "Initially liked, but now...."}

Got it through Circuit City by way of Amazon. Would have never invested in another tablet. I have a few, such as my Acer 10\", may galaxy note 10.1, and my Nook Color tablet 7\". I saw the Nook HD 7\" deal and I couldn't resist. I've always loved my Nook color but without Google Play Store it was only good for reading and movies...the apps were too limited and there weren't too many free ones. I really thought I was ok with that and just used it for Reading.Then I saw the Nook HD 7\". $129 for 8gb and $149 for the 16gb...got the 16gb...At first I thought I had made a mistake...No Google Play Store...but once it updated and I got all the Apps I wanted....Wow. It's fast..I love the screen...I love the size (which I really never thought I would), pleasing to hold and feel. I can throw this one in a purse without taking too much space! I always like the way Barnes & Noble magazines and book readers are set up. One draw back for many, is that there is no camera but I have plenty camera's (in phones and tablets). I also have considered buying the Nook HD+ 9\" tablet...that's even less, $149 for 16gb.I say...get it while you still can...I'm sure Barnes and Noble will soon be out of the tablet business. I have read articles that Microsoft is considering purchasing the rights.So if you are planning to buy a tablet and don't want to have it eat into your wallet...you'll have a blast with this one!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2013", "summary": "Love the NOOK HD 7\" with Google Play Store"}

But I am concerned about the short battery life.Pros: Light weight and smaller than the previous tablet; great video picture quality and the sound is very good even without the earbuds.Cons: I have to get used to the new interface, the previous tablet was easier to use and navigate; when playing games and connecting to the web using wi-fi, I have to charge frequently because it uses up the battery very quickly&#8212;I may have to carry my charger with me; not as many fonts to choose from like the previous tablet.Overall, I am pleased with my Nook HD Tablet.

Once inside in saw another sign for the heavily reduced price tag on the Nook Hd and nook Hd plus. I thought man for the price of the one Kindle fire hd 8.9 I could get myself two of these nook hd with cases for about the same price.So that's what I did! I got my self the smoke (grey)  and my girlfriend a snow(white)  with two flip sleep/wake cases for under 300$. The screen is super nice full 1080p with the highest ppi on any tablet.  The only tablet that can compete Round the same price point is the nexus 7 and that's still 199$.With the addition of the Google market they have turned their nook Hd into a full fledged android tablet for 129$! That is a steal for a tablet this good.Beware of the 9 inch nook Hd plus.  Even though it's the big brother of the 7 inch nook Hd it still has the same processor and it shows. The plus is sluggish while the7 inch is zippy with very few lag issues. Not sure why this but beware it is noticeable.Over all we love it! Nook Hd does everything the Kindle fire hd does for the e readers PLUS more with the addition of the Google play store.If you want to change the way the original nook operating system looks for a Google nexus 7 look then I would suggest the nova launcher in the play store.

(I might buy the B&N; tablet, but books? Amazon all the way). And free Acrobat Reader, which will still enlarge any vector line art in a PDF to 6400%, just like on a PC/Mac. Note -- Flash and video embedded in a PDF do not play on the Nook, or, to my knowledge, on any other tablet, or on Macs.Let's see. Photos (originals are 1800 x 1200) shown from my Smugmug site are razor-sharp in perfect color on the 7\" Nook screen. I'm an amateur photographer, and it's a joy to see my images displayed absolutely correctly.Other stuff -- it has a microSD card slot so you can bring in your own pix, docs, PDFs, etc. Will buy a microSD card for it tomorrow. As an aside, there's a company called N2acards that sells a microSD card pre-loaded with the Android operating system... but, with the Nook HD 'in bed' with Google, I'm not sure what I'm missing by just sticking with the Nook's built-in system.Anyway, I'm VERY happy with this product. If it blows up, I can take it back to my local B&N; store and get another.

With the way I use it, the battery life lasts for several days of reading and browsing the web. Magazines on this screen are amazing, I especially like reading Time because of the outstanding photography they do. Books look great, and the selection of games on the Barnes and Noble store is alright. A little annoying paying again for games I already bought on my phone, but that's not so bad.Further, you really don't need to pay again for games if you install a custom ROM on an SD card. You can either purchase one premade (google for N2A for more info) or you can burn your own if you google a little more and spend the afternoon trying different things. It's not scary at all, especially since you're only doing stuff on the SD card not the tablet itself. If you want to undo it, just take the card out! Anyway, the custom ROM just gets you stock android, and that opens this great device up to the full android market of games and apps. You can still read all your Barnes and Noble stuff on the B&N; android app. I read my Wired subscription that way, as well as some books. Anyway, I think this device and the ROM on the SD card is the best of B&N; and android.Anyway, I'd compare this with the Google Nexus 7. The nook has a slightly higher resolution screen, which is kinda neat especially for magazines. No front facing camera on the nook, but my phone already is great for video chat so I don't miss it. Also, the custom ROM I put on my SD card is android 4.2, whereas google says the Nexus is android 4.1...maybe they'll get an update soon I don't know. So, either way, you probably can't lose.EDIT: Barnes and Noble opened up the stock software to be able to use almost all of the apps in the google play store. So, I don't use my custom ROM at all, because of the better battery life and just overall fit and finish of the Barnes and Noble stock software.

Conflicting answers from their customer service and help staff. They obviously don't have their act together.Also interesting: it's not possible to review Nook devices on the Barnes and Noble website - no review options that, possibly because of complaint related to the issues with their chargers.

The instruction set is barely nuts and bolts but it gives one the essentials.It passed the back pocket test famously. This was done straightaway. Was very pleased with this feature.But buyer beware. I discovered this Nook tablet has no camera at all. Who ever heard of such a thing? There is a reasonable expectation.The Nook downloaded and upgraded itself famously. Everything was smooth and cheerful.The speed of the Nook was very good in my opinion. Page to page was smooth and cheerful and moderately fast. The book pages are easy to read. Another Dan Brown book (I think). Made the discovery with Inferno. Played/watched Linux Action Show and other video for about 3 hours with about 15% of the battery power left.Checked YouTube and Amazon to see the how the graphic's engine worked in the Nook. The motion pictures were crisp and clear on YouTube and Amazon. The sound was very excellent and voluminous much to my surprise. Can hear the device clearly and with ease even though I am kinda hard of hearing. The movie scenes moved like a big computer rendering of the graphics. The motion pictures were like a TV broadcast. Not kidding.Now the ultimate bummer: their much touted microSDHC card can not play your own content downloaded from a computer. Later, several hours later there was an additional patch of 75 upgrades that made the microSDHC capable of playing video files/movies. The selection it can play is very limited compared to other more recent operating systems in Android devices. The latest Android operating system is 4.4 KitKat. The Nook will not play certain AVI or HD files. It is very persnickety  What the Nook can play is rendered exceptionally well indeed. It can only play things downloaded from Nooks libraries for sale-wrong as mentioned. I would have never bought this dohickey if I knew thee was no camera natively in advance.One always takes for granted a camera. And their microSDHC is nothing short of a rip-off. Jeez- wrong now.My Chinese Brand X tablets can play my media content in AVI. MP3/4 and other popular media formats very well indeed. These Brand X tablets can play far more movie/video files than the Nook. Their Android versions are newer than the Nook's.The back pocket thing was a real plus. Great sound. Great graphics. Good speed.But these pluses can not counter balance the negatives. The camera is not as important as real robust motion graphics and awesome sound to me. Now I am thinking I will keep this Nook because it does have a viable if not bugged up microSDHC card port capable of music and motion picture replay. Forget file sharing in Android.B&N; needs a No Brainer award for greed and stupidity just like Apple, Kindle and Nexus. Apple, Kindle and Nexus deserve the No-Brainer award more because the Nook's microSDHC does work but has limited compatibility with the files/apps that can play these type of music and movie files.Now I have to go through the hassle of returning this thingamajig. May keep this on the hope there will be patches further to play music and movie files.If you need a camera don't buy this.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2014", "summary": "B&N Nook 16 Gbs Tablet Has No Camera Can Play Limited Selection of Video on microSDHC"}

I bought this device because the large screen, the sharp display, the expandable memory and the light weight were all attractive.  Prior to buying this Nook I had a Sylvania SYTAB7MX.  I had bought it to get a feel for how tablets operate.  It had limited capability, but it was cheap and served me well for about a year.  Since it was only running Android 2.0 I was excluded from a lot of apps.  I finally decided to update to the Nook.  I had several unpleasant surprises and one pleasant one.1. I found that there is no way to be rid of numerous crapplications that come on the Nook and take up memory that could be better used elsewhere.  The Sylvania had fewer of them and there was a way to remove unwanted ones there.2. I am a member of Amazon Prime and was looking forward to viewing movies on this device due to its large screen and very good graphics.  When I logged into Amazon and selected a movie to view I got this: \"Amazon Instant Video uses Adobe Flash.  We can take you to the Adobe website where you can quickly install the latest free version of the Flash.\"  Sure.  I'd go for that.  So I went to the Adobe site and got this: \"We're sorry.  This content requires Adobe Flash Player, which is not supported by your device...\"Now, thanks to a comment by Torrey Pines on my earlier review, I have learned that there is a workaround.  It requires first using Google Play on the Nook to download and install the Firefox browser application.  Then go to [...] and download and install the \"browser plugin\" application.  Although it is called a browser plugin, it comes from Adobe and is a Flash plugin.  This website downloaded the app to my library but did not install it.  I contacted Barnes and Noble support and learned that I just had to turn the device off, turn it back on and click on the browser plugin icon on the start screen and it will install.  I contacted support through this page: [...]  You send them your phone number by e-mail and someone from support will call you back.  I got called back in less than a minute.  I found this impressive.For some reason, the browser plugin will not work with the Chrome browser that is supplied on the Nook HD+.  After you install Firefox and the browser plugin and select a video to play it will first ask you if you want to use Chrome or Firefox.  You must select Firefox.  Then a gray screen will come up with a single icon in the middle with the usual \"Play\" icon.  Underneath it says to select that icon to activate the plugin browser.  Videos then play nicely.  Volume is less that when playing Netflix (which does not use the browser plugin but does require the Netflix app), but adequate.3. The Barnes and Noble web site says that this Nook has \"dual stereo speakers\".  I doubt this is true, but if it is, they \"speak\" out of a perforated area of the case measuring about 1.5\" x .5\" - hardly my idea of stereo.  The sound is clear and clean, however.4. My wife's Galaxy Tab has a way to override the limitation on whose apps you can download.  As far as I can see, there is no way to do this on the Nook HD+.The positive surprise was that I discovered the Nook has a nifty voice-command capability.I am amazed that, in spite of having spent two hours reading reviews on the Amazon and Walmart and on two sites that specialize in tablet reviews prior to purchasing it, I found nothing to suggest most of the problems I found with this device.  Having read some more reviews since first having published this review, the only place I have seen that would have tipped me off to the inability of the native Nook to play Flash video was on the site for Amazon instant video where they list the capable devices.I found reviewers who say the Nook HD+ only has one speaker, but the B&N; site says stereo.  Who was I to believe?My main complaints now are items 2 and 5 above.  Can anybody enlighten me further on these perceived shortcomings?", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "08 22, 2013", "summary": "A lot to like in spite of some annoyances"}

I added a 16gb sd card filled with thousands of my favorite songs. But, the Nook is designed to be an ereader...it is not a games tablet, or an IPad.I got my Nook Tablet (8gb version) from Barnes & Noble because of the extra discount I got with my B&N; membership...the price was MUCH less than advertised by most internet venders. I already have a Brand X color e-reader and a Nook Simple Touch reader. My old color reader was hard on my eyes for long reading sessions, the Nook Touch is great for books, but it does not have internet access or play music and magazines don't really work without a color screen.The Nook tablet has very sharp, clear, and contrasty fonts and is very pleasant to read, even for several hours. There is a night mode, and also a sephia mode for reading in bed without bothering anyone else. Magazines look great on its color screen. I listen to music on Pandora while I read, and when I am tired of reading, I can watch a movie on Netflix or a tv show on TV.com. I installed the Dolphin browser which uses tabs so I can switch quickly among various web pages.Vevo music videos look great, but the Nook's speaker is too weak to enjoy music. However, music sounds great through good ear buds and when I plug the Nook into my computer speakers.The Nook is an e-reader, NOT an I-Pad or high powered tablet. It does not have access to Google Play to obtain apps, so you are limited to the apps in the Nook app store. Those apps have been developed just for the Nook and its seven inch screen. The apps in Google Play are mostly designed for the smaller screens of cell phones, while Nook apps are designed just for the Nook.Bottom line: the Nook Tablet 8gb is a terrific way to read books and magazines while enjoying your favorite music (I loaded a 16gb memory card with thousands of my favorite songs...transferring the songs over to the Nook from my laptop was fast and easy).For folks who want the \"full\" tablet experience, Amazon.com sells the N2A card which enables you to boot your Nook into a full tablet mode, with access to Google Play, and the 400,000 apps available there. And, the N2A card also permits booting the Nook back into its original Nook settings, as the card does not modify any of the Nook's software or settings.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "04 11, 2012", "summary": "Great Color E-Reader With Extra Features"}

The software and usability is noticeably different though, and that's where you should pay close attention.  I bought my wife the Nook Tablet for Christmas and she uses it a fair amount.  I haven't heard any major complaints from her but here are the ones I've heard most often.The Barnes and Noble App Store is a joke.  I looked through it for about 5 minutes and barely ever saw a free app.  Many popular apps and games are there, but usually you can only get the paid version.  Adding insult to injury, side-loading is difficult if not impossible without rooting the device (this will void the warranty).  I didn't expect side-loading to be a given really, but if you block those apps you really need a decent App Store to make up for it.The SD card slot, which many people may not ever use, is in a pretty odd spot.  It's not really hard to pry back the cover but since you're working with a micro-SD card it can be really annoying to  line up such a tiny card in the slot.  If that wasn't annoying, it is definitely annoying to load your PDFs or whatever from the SD card once its inserted.  For someone who isn't really tech-savvy it isn't obvious how to read those files.  The reader app could really do a better job of detecting documents when the SD card is inserted.On the aesthetic side the launcher could use some work.  Although I think the scrolling app dock at the bottom is slightly more elegant than a grid-like app drawer, there's little organization to the home screen.  You can drag icons around, to and from the dock, but apps/books don't lock to any kind of grid on the home screen.  Some of us who are more anal retentive just won't stand for two icons being less than parallel.  You can see a better view of your media by opening the Library app, which is a nice app, but I find the contrast displeasing, further emphasizing this is a tablet with e-reader functions (or vice versa maybe).  Basically the cohesion isn't there and you start to wonder, with all of the restrictions, why you didn't just get a regular tablet.I still haven't rooted my wife's tablet but maybe if something annoys her enough she'll let me do it.  Otherwise, if you're not planning to root the NOOK, beware of its restrictions and browse its App Store for a bit to see if the selection and prices are a deal-breaker.  This is an e-reader FIRST and a tablet SECOND.  If you're satisfied with its e-reader capabilities I'm sure you'll be happy with this device.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "06 5, 2012", "summary": "Know What You're Buying"}

It has a great price, the screen is good and the colors look great on it, but there are two major issues that I have with this tablet that keep it from being truly great.My first issue that I have with it is that the OS/Nook Software that it comes with is extremely limited.  I bought this for my daughter last Christmas and I was sorely disappointed to see that a lot of the apps/games that she wanted either were not available at all or had a price attached to them through the B&N; store.  These are the same games you can get for free through the Google Play store.  I was pretty mystified to say the least.My next issue, and perhaps the biggest issue I have, is their charger.  It's a proprietary charger (not your standard USB universal charger) and it SUCKS.  It's the worst thing I've ever seen.  It's cheap/flimsy and I've had to replace it numerous times because the prong is extremely weak/fragile.  There's not even a good after-market charger that you can buy to rectify the situation.  All of the chargers that I've seen (whether it be through B&N; or after-market) are crap and it's only a matter of time before you'll have to replace them.  At $10 a pop (through B&N;), this can add up.I was able to solve the first problem by rooting the tablet to run Android and get the Google Play store, but sadly there's no fix to the 2nd problem and that problem can bleed your wallet over time.I really want to like this tablet because I feel like it's a great budget tablet, but when you look at the hidden costs (rooting + chargers) I'd almost be inclined to pay a little extra for something like a Kindle.In sum, it's not bad once you overcome the OS problem, but the charger will keep it from being great.  Perhaps the newer models addressed that, but on this model I'd advise to seek other options.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2014", "summary": "Very mixed feelings on this tablet"}

If your primary interest is books, this will be an excellent choice.This particular Nook occupies an interesting middle ground, so pick and choose carefully what you want and what you will use. I will try and break things down so you can make the best decision.If you ONLY want to read books, the level down from this nook is a better choice. The true eReader nook which has the actual \"e-ink\" display is the best choice if you ONLY want books. The battery life on the smaller Nooks is longer and the screen is even easier on the eyes as it is optimized for reading only.At the other extreme are people who really want something more like a tablet. If you want something  that has access to apps and also works with books, but you're not a voracious reader, you should go with either the bigger HD version of the Nook or a Kindle Fire HDThis Nook sits neatly in the middle. It's batter life is very good (but nothing close to as good as the pure eReader version) and when setup to emulate ink and paper the display is easy on the eyes (but not as good as a pure eReader). This Nook also has access to some limited apps like Pandora, Hulu and Netflix. Note - the app availability is VERY limited. I think calling this nook a \"tablet\" as it is in the product description is a bit misleading. The Nook OS is very tied town and restricted, so remember that. You will not be getting access to the android/google play store with this product. You have Barnes and Nobles limited app store only. So on the \"tablet\" front, this Nook is not as good as a Kindle Fire (But it is a better eReader).So, you just need to decide if you want:an eReader that also does a few extra things which is nice (this Nook wifi)A tablet that's also a bit of an eReader (Kindle Fire HD or upgraded Nook version)Just an eReader (the basic, no color screen Nook)Any of these products are very good, but you need to know what you want to do with it to get the best thing for you.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2013", "summary": "Probably the best eReader on the market if you want to occasionally do something else too"}

Amazon or B*N this is unethical!D.F.---------------Nook HD overviewGreat screen, no cameras, weak speakers, crappy battery life, compromised android OS, but an inexpensive way to browse web and run the world of android apps on a fast, beautiful display. Plus it has a microSD slot to hold lots of videos for offline viewing. And of course, its original purpose, to provide a slick interface for purchase and reading of magazines and books.PlusesWide range of browers available. I have 9 on my machine. All browsers for tablets have reduced functionality so some browsers are better than others for specific tasks. For example, Firefox will play video in HD and does not redirect to mobile sites. Tint and Zirco have a homepage that will access a local html file. With several browsers installed it's easier to get around site restrictions. Firefox has an addon that auto-deletes cookies. Chrome allows spoken search inputs.The world of 700,000 android apps can now be accessed on Nook HD including big and nice apps: Google earth, Skype, YouTube in HD, Adobe Reader, WiFi Analyzer, WiFi Fixer (essential Wifi tool), Google maps, best solitaire ever (by MobilityWare), and free 'run' games. Custom moving backgrounds on Nook HD home screens are fun.AnnoyancesIn two months I have not figured out how to add a browser link to Nook HD home page. Some browsers have the option to add a link to the homepage, but it never works! (It must be that the Nook HD OS does not allow this)Poor battery life, by test I get only 4 hours.Adroid apps normally just suspend, so it tends to take too many presses and taps to cleanly start an application.Audio does not shut off when you exit most radio and music apps. With no OS support for shutting apps down I often have to resort to a reset to silence them.Built-in email has a short time window so you only see few or no messages. Apps like FastHotMail can provide workaround.Screen capture is clumsy (pushing Home and Vol- requires a lot of force and nearly simultaneous pushes).Nook HD not really useful for music, sans headphones, because sound volume on speakers is relatively low.Setting up icons on home screens is kind of a pain. Half of the main screen is taken up by a carousel that cannot be removed. The Nook recommended way of moving an icon to an adjacent screen is to hold icon overlapping the edge, but I find this hit or miss, it only seems reliable after a reset.File directories can be accessed via USB, but have some annoyances: Many file managers have a hard time finding personal files lost in a maze of OS directories. Nook HD allows deletion of its standard user directories (like 'kids B&N; files') only to later write them back again.Tablet does not reliably remember some settings. Occasionally I find the screen will be dim or the notification is too loud and when I look the setting has changed.No way (that I have found) to add personal data for quick entry.(update)Bluetooth keyboard problem solvedI have an inexpensive bluetooth keyboard that works fine with another tablet (Blackberry Playbook), but I could not get it to work with Nook HD. It would pair fine, but nothing happened when keys are hit. I see others complaining of this too. Finally I solved the problem with an app called BlueInput (available on Play Store). It now does the pairing, not Nook OS, and you select the bluetooth keyboard using 'Switch Keyboard' icon.(update)Fix for adding web link icons to the home page. Some browsers have the option to add a bookmark to Home, but this never seemed to work in Nook HD. I think I now understand the source of the problem. The default Nook HD launcher (with carousel) ignores them. The work around is to install the Nova launcher, and it will show them on the home screens.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "07 26, 2013", "summary": "Cheap way to browse web and run android apps on a fast, beautiful display"}

The web may be a little, very little bit slow, but that goes with most tablets; even the ipad. It plays youtube smoothly, has good screen quality, has email, and other web related things like netflix and pandora. This tablet's speaker quality is ok, but not if you're often working in a loud place.If you want a tablet for apps: Look elsewhere. This tablet, although is great for web quality, has a poor app selection. Some of the best ones, in my opinion it has are Temple Run Brave, Fruit Ninja, and several angry bird games, however according to buyers who have had the device longer, it took a long time for even those to come out. (I could be wrong; got that peice of info off other reviews)If you just want to read and have a little of everything above: Then this is perfect. If you're not so much into the web, not too crazy about apps, but still want it as a backup as you read, then this tablet is your type. It's simple, cute, and does well with it's tasks. Nice book selection; had everyone i searched forIn General:-There are no cameras, neither front or back, but if you don't do skype and don't really care about photos, it wont make a difference.-The apps and books they have are very expensive!I've seen nook apps (nook apps in general; all nooks)shockingly expensive while other tablets such as the kindle fire has those same apps for free-You can modify the brightness when you read books, and you can bookmark them as well.Overall, this simple tablet is for those who don't really care about apps. It does everything else quite well! Would probably make a nice gift for parents who enjoy reading but are kind of hectic (all their books in one place; the nook itself), or a young child who doesn't mind not having all the, \"cool\" apps.

Well for the reading part, the Nook worked great as long as you were getting books from B&N.; Trying to get e-books from Amazon was not an option. The available apps from the Nook store were very limited compared to Amazon and Google Play store as well. And using this Nook for web browsing or purchasing music was a joke. I had a Kindle and swapped with my Wife as she wanted all the Amazon access and I like to tinker.I purchased a Android For Nook (AFN) card and went through the rooting process which was easy for people who can read direction and program clocks on VCR's. This improved the Nook from a glorified e-book reader to a full fledged Android Tablet. The version of Android (CyanogenMod) used is Gingerbread which is very stable. Not cutting edge but worlds better than the B&N; operating system. I was able to add both Nook and Amazon Kindle apps for reading as well as opening a world of apps from Google Play. The tablet is mostly used for games and movies for the kids, which both work quite well with the Nook now. Infact I would rank the Nook with the AFN modification as a better overall tablet then the Kindle since it provides for addition storage (up to 32gb) and is very easy to root. My biggest complaint left (same as the Kindle) is a lack of camera, gps, and bluetooth.In stock form, this tablet is a 2 star product because of the crapware Nook OS.

I'll explain why I went with a Nook Tablet over a Kindle Fire and why I think most people may (or may not) want to do the same thing.Note: In the interst of comparing similarly priced models, I'll compare the 8GB Nook Tablet with the 8GB Kindle Fire which are currently the same price.Hardware:Nook hardware is better than Kindle hardware. The Nook has an internal microphone and an expansion slot for a MicroSD card. Expandable memory is a huge deal. The Kindle Fire does have the old \"Gorilla Glass\", but that's a minor point. The Nook also has more glare-resistant glass. The ergonomics of the Nook are better as well.Software:Nook software is draconian. The operating system is a neutered version of the Android OS and the Google Market is off-limits. The software library is very small and almost nothing is free. This isn't necessarily as bad as it sounds at first though. If you have the technical know-how, you can replace the factory software on the Nook with an alternative OS like Cyanogen Mod. The easiest way to do this is via a specially programmed MicroSD card (which would require that you spend the money on the extra card), although you can also do this by overwriting the internal software as well (note that this IS undoable).My Recommendation:I encourage you to put a 3rd party OS on the device regardless of whether you get a Nook or a Kindle Fire. Either way, by replacing the OS you can read both B&N; Books and Kindle books on the same device (as well as use most of the other standard Google Market apps). If you are ambitious enough and feel like you have the skill, get a Nook to mod. If you plan on using the device out-of-the-box with no changes, get a Kindle Fire instead.Other thoughts:I'm really disappointed in B&N; for locking down the device so much. When it was first released, the device supported \"side-loading\" where you could install apps via MicroSD card.

It was obvious B&N; was simply trying to lock down the device further, not actually provide any sort of performance, reliability, or feature enhancements. In fact, this kind of \"update\" was actually a big step backwards. I've heard rumors that Google will soon be developing their own tablet.

Great for reading books and netflix. Battery life - Read 'Catching Fire' and 'Mockingjay' on a single charge. Email and web are decent too - nothing special.Cons:The B&N; Nook OS and the B&N; App selection are both terrible. The Nook OS is counter-intuitive and not user friendly, there is no BACK button!? Take a toll of how often you use the BACK button on your phone or android device and you'll realize how annoying the lack of this simple common-place feature is. You can hit the 'N' and go back to home any time - though often I wanted to go Back, not start over. The selection of apps in the app store are laughable. I literally could not find a single app I wanted, even searching apps that they advertise like Comics for nook (not installed? not available?). I found a few apps for $4.99+ that i have downloaded for free on Itunes and Google play (android market).Recommendation:BUY THIS -N2A (TM) - 32GB Nook to Android bootable microSD Card for the Nook ColorTakes the Good hardware of the Nook Tablet and replaces the useless OS with trusted Full Android. Read the reviews, they are all true! Before i bought this card, the nook was basically useless and frustrating - now I have an android tablet and since it is NOT rooted, still have warranty too, though I recommend squaretrade. Check my N2A review for more info.Update: I have had this tablet for over 6 months now and love it. I have had no issues and all my friends and family want one. Note: I use this exclusively with the N2A card in Android mode. N2A recently emailed me with the update from Gingerbread to Jellybean and its working great and their customer service is excellent.

One of the most important feature I found on the new nook was better page turn response. The screen refresh when moving from page to page is much quicker, nearly matching the refresh rates of the latest Kindle. The Nook also added a laundry list of interface and usability improvements, such as the ability to organize your book collection by category which is called \"shelves\".I liked 600 X 800 display screen. It comes with 16 shades of gray and is easy to your eyes. I can read all day without hurting my eyes. My personal opinion, i would love this device more if I could read it at night without lights.ProsLibrary with thousands of books, magazine that comes free, built-in free wireless data network, plus Wi-Fi connectivity (no PC needed); separate capacitive color touch-screen pad for navigation, and a virtual keyboard for notes and annotations; 2GB of internal memory (capable of storing 1,500 electronic books) as well as a microSD expansion slot for additional memory; font style and size are adjustable; displays image files and plays MP3 music files; compatible with Windows and Mac machines; battery is removable and user-replaceable; allows free browsing of full-text books while within Barnes & Noble stores; you can lend certain e-books for up to 14 days free of charge; EPUB format compatibility lets you read free Google Books and loaner e-books from your local library; page turn speeds are faster with firmware upgrade.The bad: No protective carrying case included; color LCD ( for color nook)  has an impact on battery life; for black & white battery is really good,in-store reading and loaning capabilities come with notable limits and caveats; no support for Word or text files; no ability to download books when outside the U.S., even when on Wi-Fi.Does it beat Kindle?According to design my answer is no.  The third-generation Amazon Kindle is lighter, thinner, and simply feels a little better to hold in your hand. It also offers double the battery life, more internal memory (4GB versus 2GB). But the new upgrades has given some new features to nook that are not available in kindle. Nook should definitely remain under consideration when you're shopping for e-ink e-book readers. The decision may come down to a personal preference, such as how you feel about the color navigation screen versus the hard keyboard found on the Kindle.If my review did not answer any questions, leave a comment below and I will try my best to answer your question.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2010", "summary": "Worthy wifi e-reader for everday reader."}

The device comes with one year warranty, I took it to the store and they replaced it in 5 minutes, again, the store experience was great.Pros:1- The device look and feel is good, design is sleek and smooth.2- Touch screen is a good idea, I have tendinitis so I prefer to use touch screen over keyboard.3- The page turn keys are in good place, very comfortable to read and hold at the same time.4- Found many books on the library search, it has detailed editorial and user reviews, with ratings, just like Amazon site.5- The format is not proprietary, this was a huge sale point for me, there are other devices that can read the same format.6- Battery is replaceable and memory SD slot is available.Cons:1- The touch screen is sluggish, you need to use it slower than using other touch devices, this is either buggy hardware or CPU is too slow.2- First device I got was defective, not a good sign, hopefully the second one is better.3- Browsing the web is ok, but using the small touch screen to navigate through HTML is not an easy task, especially since it is sluggish.4- Not all books are available in the on-line library, I found a psychology book in the store that did not exist for download.5- You need to use screw driver to open the back cover and replace battery or insert SD card.6- Little bit heavy, certainly heavier than a medium size hard cover book.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "09 18, 2010", "summary": "So far so good.."}

I discovered that the nook was easier to upload and download material onto but it was not as accessible as far as distribution and popularity of ebooks, it lags behind the kindle in popularity because it seems like an imitator.  Some time has to go by since the kindle came out then Nook should make some huge improvements, this is a way that it could overtake the kindle because Barnes & Noble has brick and mortar stores to sell their Nooks and books in which is where most people would come across reading devices.

While there were things about the Kindle I really liked (better screen contrast, and many other features that other reviewers on the Kindle site had written), the one thing that made me choose the Nook was the ability to borrow and read ebooks from my local library. Haven't been back to the library since!Now here comes the Nook Simple Touch (Nook ST) ereader. It is just now starting to show up in B&N; stores (not on Amazon yet). I was lucky enough to find a store near me that had one that was not spoken for yet. I bought it yesterday and have been busy trying it out. It has the same e-ink Pearl screen as the Kindle, so the screen contrast is no longer an issue. And wow, has the user interface improved over the original Nook! (which I thought was clunky) The entire e-ink Pearl screen has full touchscreen capability. On both the Kindle and the original Nook, I felt myself wanting to touch the screen to select a book to read, instead of using the buttons (on the Kindle) or the LCD touchscreen (on the original Nook) to highlight and select the desired ebook. On the Nook ST, the Library screen shows icons for all the ebooks loaded in the device (both library and purchased). Touch the icon, and the ebook opens. Turning the page? Touch the screen on the right side of the page (to go forward) or the left side (to go back). Or swipe your finger across the screen as in flipping a physical book page. Or use the buttons built into the frame. Want to page quickly through a book? Hold down the page turning button. Need a word definition? Touch and hold on the word and a dictionary pops up. The user interface resembles that of an iPhone or iPad, with the icons, virtual keyboard and the physical home button. It even has the \"slide to unlock\" feature like the iPhone.  The touchscreen on the Nook ST is infrared (it senses the heat of your finger, again like iPhone), so a light touch works just fine.  I found that on the original Nook, sometimes it would take multiple touches on the LCD screen for the device to recognize a command.I returned the original Nook since the Nook ST is so much better. Note that the Nook ST doesn't have 3G connectivity, a web browser, or an MP3 player. If you want all that, buy the original Nook. If you don't require all of these features and would like a basic e-reader with an intuitive touch screen interface, then take a look at the Nook ST.The Nook ST is just beginning to become available (only at B&N; right now), but I suspect that Amazon and other high quality retailers will be selling it very soon.Here's another plus for the Nook (whether it is the original one or the ST).  The Kindle has a proprietary ebook format that limits your options in purchasing and reading ebooks.  Nook uses Adobe EPUB, which is an open format and there are multiple online sites that offer books in this format (including most public libraries).", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "06 5, 2011", "summary": "This Nook is Good, but the new Nook Simple Touch is WAY Better"}

My mom (&lt;3!!) gave me my brothers old nook since he had a new nook color so I could download and read the series on this. It wasn't cheap to download the books, but compared to reading the free versions a friend had sent me (which were horrible because the text was all messed up...typos galore) but the option to make the text larger or smaller and the clarity of the screen made the 8+ dollars per book soooo worth the price.The battery on this lasts so long it's insane. I would read daily maybe 5 hours per day over the summer (hey, I had to finish the series before school resumed!) and I only had to charge it once a week tops, even then the battery wasn't drained I just didn't want to give it a chance to run out. I am so in love with my nook now it's insane. I can download almost any book I could possibly need and carry it around in this tiny little, lightweight nook.Another big plus....MY BOOKMARKS DON'T FALL OUT OF THE NOOK!! Nothing is more frustrating than losing your place and going bananas trying to find it without revealing something you haven't read yet.Also, when it comes to textbooks this is a lifesaver!!

It  offers greater compatibility with different ebook formats than the Kindle (particularly the EPUB format), has access to special offers when you're inside a Barnes and Noble store, and permits you to lend books to other Nook users. There's also a little color LCD touch screen at the bottom for accessing menu options.Personally, I haven't taken advantage of most of the Nook's features yet, but I do like what I see so far. The touchscreen adds a great deal of versatility to the device and I'd say it's easier to access menu options this way than with just one e-ink screen and some buttons. I also appreciate the ability to upgrade the memory with a microSD card, but I would have preferred to do so without opening the device. Also, if you have a problem with the Nook, you shouldn't have a problem getting a replacement. I, er, damaged my first Nook through, shall we say, \"user error,\" but B&N; staff was happy to provide a new one for me.It's not quite perfect, though. It's kind of heavy, for one thing. The touchscreen is a bit slow to respond and can significantly drain the battery, for another. And, some of the Nook's buttons seem to be a little too stiff. I prefer soft, clicky buttons, you know? Maybe in its next iteration the Nook will have proper buttons instead of this \"bendy plastic\" business.Anyway, which e-reader you get largely boils down to your personal preferences, and which retailer's online library you'd rather have access to. For my part, I think the Nook satisfies all of my needs just fine. Be careful where you buy it from, though. $180, which is the price it's selling for on Amazon right now, is way too much when you can just walk into a brick and mortar store and get it for thirty bucks less.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 20, 2011", "summary": "An excellent e-reader"}

I watch a lot of TV at home.  It is time to change - i want to read like good old times before college.  So the purpose of an e-ready was ONLY for reading.  I spent a lot of time reading, comparing (online and in stores) this nook, to other versions of nook and to kindle.  Here is why I chose this nook (wifi only):1. I can use public books without a lot of conversion.  Nook is not nearly as restrictive as Kindle.2. I don't need the 3G (which works in the US only).  I plan what I want to read or I download many books, so I have many good choices if I want to read already in the ereader.3. Wifi can be connected to WEP secured network.

I read that Kindle cannot connect to a secured network and unsecuring a netwrok is a major pain.4. Nook connects via USB to my computer.  You can just donwload the books (epub format) directly into Nook, without stupid programs or interfaces (just like copying from one folder to another in USB flash drive).  I discovered that I dont even need WIFI - really....5. Nook Color is an LCD screen.  I make enough money to buy an i-pad if I needed an LCD screen.

I wanted to consider a Kindle but they were not available locally so I was very hesitant to buy one sight-unseen.BN had just released their wifi-only version for $149 which was very reasonable. I bought one from BN with moderate research and minimal hands-on. I have regretted it ever since.Today I said goodbye to my nook library and bought a kindle3. I can't comment on it very much except it is light-years faster than the nook and the interface actually works. I have about 90 books in my nook library, most of which I paid for so I'm a little frustrated.Things that are good about the nook:1. It looks much better than a kindle. While it sits there unused on my nightstand.2. ePub support. I live in Alaska which means it will be another 5 years before our libraries start loaning books via epub so it's not a big deal for me.3. Free Fridays. Every Friday nook owners can download a BN-selected book for free. Most are crappy fantasy/romance books but I have discovered several very good authors that I wouldn't have otherwise.Things that are bad about the nook:1. Awful, awful, awful touch input. I cringe thinking about using my nook with the unwieldy touchscreen. The screen itself is slow to respond, it sometimes registers additional clicks but mostly just ignores them while giving you visual feedback so you wait 5-10 seconds for it to actually do nothing.The touchscreen display is very jerky and difficult to navigate. You navigate the menus by scrolling through them on the touchpad. It will randomly jump to the top or the bottom. It will randomly ignore a touch (there is visual feedback, so it's not a mis-touch). It will randomly click twice on the succeeding menus.Trying to type on the keyboard or use it to look up a word (you need to use arrow keys on the touchpad to scroll a sluggish cursor around the page to pick one) is a test in patience I no longer have patience for. The keys provide visual feedback when pressed. This suggests you can type away merrily until you look at the text field to see only 2 or 3 characters were actually used. You have to type very sloooow and deliberate for the gnomes inside to catch up with you.The touchscreen is the main reason I ditched the nook. It is horribly implemented and makes the entire device borderline unusable.2. Browser. The BN rep sure talked that up. After spending 15 minutes trying to use the browser to register a BN account so I could actually read books I gave up and used my laptop. The browser takes about 30 seconds on average to display a page. It doesn't matter if it's a real page, the mobile version of Facebook or just google search. It will also randomly crash every minute or two. And by crash I mean you will suddenly be returned to the home screen for no apparent reason.Do not buy the nook if you even think you might want to try using it as a browser to check your email while you're sitting in bed reading a book.3. Battery life sucks. Sorry, but it does. I like to read a lot and having to charge it every couple days makes me upset they claim a 14-day battery life on it. I think it gets about 14 hours per charge (minus the 10% when it automatically goes to sleep). There is a persistent charging bug with the nook, or at least with mine; If you have wifi enabled but the device is sleeping (as in just normally leaving wifi on) when you plug it in to charge, the wifi will activate internally as it (I assume) checks with BN for book updates. This stops the charging and it will not resume unless you turn off the wifi and unplug and replug the charging cable.This is very frustrating as you plug the device in and forget to turn off the wifi. The next morning you grab it only to see the cute \"Your battery is too low to operate\" message.4. It weighs about 20% more than the kindle and is noticeably thicker. Not a big deal, but if you're in bed reading with one hand it weighs about as much as a heavier hardcover which means you're switching hands every so often. Heavier does not always mean better.5. Page turns. When I first got the nook it took between 3-5 seconds to turn a page. I would actually press the page turn button when I got to the last paragraph and could finish it before the page turned. A software update has vastly improved the page turn speed (about .5 seconds now) but only when turning the actual book pages. Library pages, shopping and browsing shelves still take 3+ seconds. I have tried a factory reset twice and either my device is defective (BN support did not think so) or it still sucks. This also strongly influences the cursor movement speed when trying to select a word and the speed at which you can enter text.6. Screen readability is acceptable. It looks like the page was printed on a crappy inkjet printer, with pixilation apparent. The kindle is more crisp and darker.7. The included Merrium Webster dictionary is broken. A large number of entries simply do not work. If you search for one of the effected entries the nook performs a search before inexplicably returning you to the book page. I do not remember which letter(s) are affected but it does not appear to be priority for BN to fix.8. Shelves. Shelves are BN's answer to everyone complaining how difficult it is to find books in the library. You can create a custom named shelf and place books on it. It is very clunky and sluggish and expect to spend 30 seconds trying to find your new book and another 15 trying to put it on a shelf. Sometimes it just won't let you put a book on a shelf and you have to restart the nook. This adds another 2 hours because you will be so frustrated by this point you will put the nook down start punching holes in the wall.9. Sometimes books fail to open. This means you have to go back to your library and open the book again. I have no idea why it happens but it happens frequently enough to mention. Once you get a book open and keep reading that book until you're finished it works well enough. But the menus, navigation and overall usefulness is virtually nonexistent.10. It's built on an android platform, which means it's buggy and randomly crashes or stops working. A restart usually solves this, but I keep shouting \"WHY, WHY, WHY\" every time I have to. Although I haven't had to restart it since I got the kindle. This may or may not be a result of not using it any more.Closing thoughts: I would encourage you very strongly to use one before buying it and investing in an e-library only to find yourself in the same situation I found myself. If you really have your heart set on it, buy from a local BN and try it out for a couple weeks so you can return it. I waited for the nook software update that was supposed to fix all these problems. After that seemingly only addressed the page turn speed I was outside of the return period and stuck with this nice-looking nightstand decorum.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2011", "summary": "Save your money, or 10 reasons the nook is awful"}

At the current price, I think it's a good deal but I'm not sure it would be my choice if I could roll back time.  I originally purchased this because I wanted to rent ebooks from the Library and that wasn't an option with the Kindle.  Now, they come for the Kindle as well as in epub and pdf formats.  You can basically use any ereader to rent these now.I read all these reviews saying that the black and white was like paper, easiest to read.  It's not anything like a paper book, it's far less \"bright\" when it comes to reading.  Don't get me wrong, I love ebooks.  I haven't read a paper book in a year.  It is just that even in regular light it is not as easy to see for me.  You absolutely can read it without a light during the day, but it is not nearly as crisp or easy as it would be with a paper book.  I have a clip on light, and with that it's perfect at night.  I'm able to read in bed and not disturb my husband, if one wants a black and white reader as close to paper as you can get--I'm just not sure this is what one would expect.This reader has a browser which you can use to get on the internet.  It was handy when we were in a hotel with wifi and I didn't bring the laptop and I needed to know when a business opened.  It's certainly not easy to surf, this would not be my choice to use unless in a pinch.The battery does not last as long as I expected.  I get maybe a week and a half out of it, if I turn it completely off when not using it--and if I have it on airplane mode (not wifi enabled).  I do read at least a few hours a day.  The time is much shorter if I let it just hibernate.I am not sure if the text size options are specific to the device or the book.  It appears to me it is the device that offers limited options, though it varies based on the originating text of the book. The text size on extra large--the largest option-- is often (it varies by book) small enough that it would equal that of a normal book.  My vision is pretty good and occasionally I'm annoyed by how small extra large is.  In some books medium is the same as extra large in others.  I do think that for anyone with vision challenges, limited text size might be an issue.Obtaining books is easy to do through Barnes and Noble.  You need to go online on a computer and provide a credit card.  You can then order them on the computer, or through your device.  I generally use the computer, but if you know what you want--ordering directly from the Nook is quick and easy.  Transferring library rentals is also as easy as drag and drop, using Adobe Digital Solutions (free app, the library should have a link to download it).All in all, it's a good ereader.  I've never had any mechanical issues with it.  It is sturdy and reliable.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "11 26, 2011", "summary": "Not Sure I'd Do It Over Again"}

I had a tough time deciding between the nook and the Kindle.  I've seen the Kindle, and there isn't much difference.  The Kindle is thinner, but the nook is by no means bulky.  The screens look identical to me and seem clearer than actual paper.  The touch screen on the nook will use up the battery quickly if you use it too much.  There are two main reasons that I chose the nook.  First, because I can replace the battery myself.  The Kindle works like an iPod, where you have to send it back to Amazon to have the battery replaced.  This was a big selling point for me.  While I understand that I would still own all of the books that I purchased, I'd still rather be able to replace this myself if necessary.  My second reason is that the nook supports more types of files, including files from public libraries.  The Kindle seems to really be geared towards Amazon purchased books.  I'm sure that as competition grows, Amazon will probably make the Kindle more compatible with other formats, but I chose the e-reader that seemed to me to have more options.  There is honestly not much difference between these two e-readers.

Well many moons ago I worked at Barnes and Noble and stopped in to visit and old friend.  He introduced me to the Nook, I shrugged up my nose and said, 'Yeah, I'm sold on the Kindle.'After playing around with the Nook, I really found myself enamored of it.  I like the touch screen.  I like that the battery replacement if necessary is something the consumer can do.  I liked that you could share your nook books with others.  On the Nook that I have -and I did purchase a refurbished Nook - games included are suduko and chess.  The daily is a feature that automatically downloads articles specifically for the Nook users.  The library is where you can store all of your books and create shelves for your titles and organize the titles.  Shopping is a breeze, either directly on the nook or online.  You will need a card, be it debit or credit to purchase the books, you can use gift cards, but I believe that you need to have a card on file.I can store and listen to music on my Nook, I can access the internet (mine is WiFi) and use it to search and answer email or update facebook.In short, I'm madly in love with it.  I have not had any problems with it.  The charge holds for a pretty long time, I haven't measured it in time myslef.It is simple to use, very friendly and there is an incredible book selection for the Nook.  i happen to be a big fan of classic literature and Russian literature and I have had no trouble filling up my library.  Storage capacity is quite large and i have an additional micro SD card just in case, but I am no where near filling up my storage yet.The books are also available on my personal computer, and if I decide to archive a book, but do not necessarily want to delete the title altogether, I can archive it and later retrieve that title from my online account.  Archiving titles would allow you to free up space on your Nook.Recommendations, I have a silicone slip cover to protect my Nook if I drop it, I also have a slightly hardcover case to protect the Nook when it is in my purse, I do have a book light as the screens are not backlit to avoid glare.The only downside, some fools will think your screen is paper and they will touch it in awe and smudge up your reading screen.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 30, 2010", "summary": "I really love this"}

I haven't bought a book since I bought the NOOK four months ago.The display is incredible.  I sit in the sun and read a lot, and the brighter the sunlight, the better the display.  Try that with a traditional LCD display.  Since the black and white NOOK has no backlight for the book pages, it requires as much ambient light as a traditional paper book.  In dim lighting I use a clip-on book light, as I did with paper books.While I can use the NOOK several hours a day for several days between charges, an hour or two a day of charging keeps it charged.  The NOOK Color has a much shorter battery life, as well as being heavier.The 3G option for the NOOK is a waste of money unless you want to buy books and magazines directly from Barnes & Noble, or if you want to try to use the NOOK as a tablet computer.

I was an English major in college and I read tons of books so for a long time I went back and forth between the kindle and the nook. I love amazon, but the nook appealed to me more. I finally bought the nook just after I graduated because I had some leftover graduation money and I am so glad I did. The only thing I might have done differently would be to have paid the extra fifty dollars for the free 3g. I don't really use the web browser, but it would be nice to have since I don't get web on my phone. Anyway, the browser is actually not that bad, if you view a regular web page you have to pan side to side to see the whole thing, so for emails I just use the mobile version of yahoo and gmail since I just have to scroll up and down. The browser works well for basics, like email, checking movie times, and a quick wikipedia search.The nook really isn't any heavier than most books (except maybe mass market paperbacks) and I find it to be very comfortable to hold (though usually I prefer holding it with a cover on so it's more like a book). I love the way the books can be organized in different categories. Usually I just organize them by date last opened though since I read more than one book at a time and can therefore have all the books I'm reading at the top of the list. I also love the touch screen it's not perfect (iPod touch and iPhone touch screens are much better), but I don't mind. The games that are included are absolutely perfect for me too. I love chess and sudoku and hopefully they'll add more in the future to be downloaded, but I'm happy with just those two. The screens contrast is great and while the new Kindle says it has better contrast, I honestly don't think I'd need it to be better. I can read perfectly fine and pictures look great on the screen. Another thing that I love about the nook is that you can personalize the screensaver and background (I know that's not really important, but I like having my favorite pics on my nook).Anyway, I'm really happy with the nook and I think it was well worth the money. An ereader will never take the place of actual books for me, I still buy both. I usually read free classics and pay for the books that I know I won't really ever want to read again (like the paperbacks I used to buy from target or walmart). Other books that I know I will want to keep to reread, I buy the physical copy. I love the price of ebooks too. Usually they are either equal to or less than the cost of regular books and you can sometimes find them for super cheap! I've never tried the kindle, but honestly I'd say they're probably fairly equal when it comes down to it (I mean really reading a book on a screen doesn't vary that much). If you just go with whichever one sounds better to you, then you'll probably be happy, I know I am!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2010", "summary": "Fantastic!"}

I begin to research e readers.. I even went to the store and tested the nook, played with it. I went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well. Then one of my coworkers showed me her Kindle and I was able to play with it and look at it.Then the i pad came out, So I went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well. I have read review after review and watched you-tube...Well The holidays came and my husband bought me the Nook!!! I was so excited! I wanted the Nook as soon as I saw it, but took my time and compared it to other e readers.. I knew right from the start which e reader I wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of them.Right out of the box the Nook, made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the Nook. My husband knew that I wanted it, but I waited trying to justify why I needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations. The Nook did exactly that! For me the Nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase... Here is why I love the Nook, I can lend books to other, I can download from my library which is so awesome! I can surf the net for FREE!!!!!! no monthly fees like the i pad, It fits in my computer bag, purse, which makes it so easy to take with me, It has my favorite games, Chess and Sukodu! It was easy for me to download a ebook that I already have, but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around, the book loaded right from my lap top to the Nook in no time... The amount of free books that are available to the Nook, and the daily free treats from Barnes And Nobles! Which will more than pay for the Nook over time. Being able to call Barnes and Nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer service.I also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks! For me It was the right choice for our family, as when we go to Barnes and Nobles with our children we can stay longer now that we have the nook and can receive free treats and more free ebooks! It pays for itself... These are some of the reason why I love my nook and I am excited that I received the Nook for a gift! I can not say enough about the Nook, I don't have to be tied to one book store like Itunes, Ibook, are the Kindle store... I don't like limits and the Nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books from...Now with that said, When I visited my local Barnes and Nobles and received a free smoothie, It was so stress free and everyone was so nice.. I could not believe it!I have also downloaded music that I can listen to and have my ear plugs for that, I have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that I was shocked! I like getting my monies worth, and not having to pay extra monthly fees.Now with that said, I hope that when you do your research you will consider the Nook, I am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews. Well back to my Nook, as I can not put it down!What a great gift, and a great buy!!!**************Update****************5/30/2011The Nook is still awesome... Since I have owned the Nook for a while now, I came back to offer an update..As far as downloading books, I downloaded books the other day and before I could blink they were on my Nook!I am still happy with my Nook and love my Nook! I have recommended the Nook to friends and family who have also made purchases and are happy with the Nook as well.The performance of my Nook is awesome, and I have had great experiences with my Nook since the day I was surprised with the Nook as a gift! Best gift anyone can give! The joy of reading!I take my Nook with me every where! My children are still in love with my Nook and love to play the games on my Nook or read a book. My husband even likes for the children to read books on the Nook. The Nook has brought so much fun and the joy of reading to our family!You can also go to Barnes and Nobles and take classes to learn more about your Nook as there is so much to learn and so much that the Nook has to offer. Check in your area to see what times your local Barnes and Nobles offers classes.I also like the Nook because the Nook continues to educate you on a daily basis with the daily blog of what took place on the days of the week, for example if you turn on your Nook right now and go to the daily, it will inform you what took place on this date. Which to me is a neat feature as you get to learn something new about something you may have  not known.As far as the touch screen part of the Nook, we love it! It does not distract us but adds to the beauty of the Nook in our opinion. It is easy for my family to use.********2012 Update*****Well it is 4/24/2012 and I still love my Nook and my Nook still works great! I just wanted to give another update for individuals looking for a e reader.As of this date, our children are now asking as they did before can they have my Nook. And for now they can use my Nook, but I still love Nook and I am not ready to give my Nook up. One day we will purchase Nooks for the whole family.As far as use, I was out in the sun and reading with no problem. So many e reads and tablets are currently on the market. This nook still works for me and still performs and amazes me. There is still so much to learn with the Nook I currently own. If you are looking for a great affordable e reader. Don't over look Nook.  Good luck with your decision.Hopefully this update will help you in your decision. We would by one hundred more and pass them out as gifts and charity, just so people can get to read and find joy in reading! Great tool to use to educate children and adults!Back to my Nook!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2010", "summary": "Great E-Reader 2012 and Nook Still Rocks!"}

I've also spent dozens of hours on the telephone with Nook support and other activities related to keeping it running.  I'm an experienced software designed/programmer, engineer, etc. and I can assure you that compared to a paper book, this is a seriously flawed concept.  If you insist on buying an eBook reader, make sure you allocate plenty of time that you could have better spent on reading a real book to spend on arguing on the telephone with foreign call center reps.  B&N;'s concept of customer support is severely lacking and they appear to have little knowledge when it comes to supporting electronic gear.On top of those problems, consider the very concept of the electronic book.  While you will pay close to the same price you'd pay for a real book on sale, you won't own the book - you'll have a license to use it.  When you're finished with the book, maybe you'd like to be able to loan it to a relative or friend, but you can only do that if they have a Nook and you can loan it for two weeks only.  I suppose when the two weeks is up, the borrower sees the book disappear, finished or not.And then there's the odd problem of your Nook for some reason being tied closely to the email address you had on file with B&N; when you registered your Nook.  I recently had to change my email address and updated my B&N; account with the new address and new B&N; password.  After that, I could no longer download books, and was unable to unregister and register my Nook (that was supposed to fix the problem, according to the support center).  If you happen to get yourself into that dilemma, be ready for a long drawn-out session on the telephone.  The problem was that B&N; neglected to spell this situation out on their website when I changed my email address.So, if you're into \"going green\", driving a hybrid car (and thinking it's going to save you money in the long run), then the Nook may be for you.  If all you want to do is read, forget the Nook and go to the local library or bookstore and spend your time reading.  Give the price of the Nook to a local charity.  Everyone will be happier.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "03 11, 2012", "summary": "Run the other way"}

I found the reading experience much less pleasurable than a paper book.  The screen contrast is too low to read in low-light situations, the page turning mechanism is clunky, the page has an annoying way of flashing at every page turn, and the tactile experience is just not satisfying.The deciding factor, however, was the problem I had with connectivity.  The nook would not connect to wireless hotspots in several of my favorite coffee shops, and I found it impossible to transfer ebooks from my iBook.  I spoke with the experts at Barnes & Noble, who told me that the nook works better with some hotspots than others, and that yes, there can be compatibility problems with Macs.  In the end, I was reduced to using the nook to buy ebooks at my local Barnes & Noble store, where I discovered that seemingly all of the million-plus free books are OCR translations that have not been proofed.  They were so full of typos that they were virtually unreadable.In the end, I decided that the nook is really not market-ready.

Apparenty this happens when you don't update often enough, and there are no cues for updating that I have seen. I saved the books to my computer so I'm okay, except for the unnessesary hassle, but make sure you save the books elsewhere!

So far, here are my impressions/experiences. Boycotting Amazon so purchased Nook. Took it out of box. A little heavier than expected. Didn't get a chance to handle one at the store (B&N;). Viewing screen is smaller than a paperback book, so not sure why my wife wanted it anyway.I created an account on B&N; but failed to add credit card info because it wasn't required. Tried to register. It seemed stuck on 'Registering Nook, should only take a few moments\" screen. It never gave any indication as to why it wouldn't finish registering. So, wife read instructions and noted that a Credit Card must be added to account. Did so and it registered relatively quickly.Purchased a cover for it the next day (relatively expensive).Wife finally picked a book. I went to B&N; website, purchased the Nook version online. Waited the promised 60 seconds and it wasn't on the Nook. Went to the website and it said it 'Hasn't been delivered yet'. What??? (My credit card was charged within a millisecond but the book wasn't delivered? After 2 hour wait, finally called their tech support. Foreign gentleman told me to wait until the morning and check again (although he did say \"I don't want to set an expectation of delivery time\" [I don't think he was supposed to say that out loud]). So, I purchase an ebook and it still takes 14 hours to deliver????? Certainly DID NOT meet my expectation. I thought I could be on a beach, purchase the book and it be on my Nook before the Margarita arrived. That is what they lead you to believe.Anyways, woke up in the morning and turned it on. Book was finally there.So, so far, doesn't meet my expectations. Not sure if Kindle would do any better, but as stated, wasn't buying an Amazon product.UPDATE: Jan 4. Well, I was wrong. When I said book was there, I guess it was in a 'list' on my nook. Apparently you still have to 'download' it. So, I hit the 'download' button. All I'm getting is \"Download Queued: Will Complete Shortly\". That's been on there for an hour. I'm waiting for tech support. I am seriously considering taking it back tomorrow. I will, of course, forfeit the $30+ I spent for a cover at best buy, but at this point that is the lesser of two evils. BN website actually says \"Download wirelessly in seconds!\"UPDATE2: Jan 10. Before I returned my Nook to BN, I decided to try to download the book at work. The Nook connected to our wireless and downloaded pretty quickly. So... it appears that even though the Nook shows fully connected to my home wireless, with great reception, there is still a problem there. I'm not sure why the Nook doesn't at least tell me that there is a problem though. (it's not my internet connect, on night in question tested download speeds on wirelessly connected laptop and got outstanding results). Anyways, didn't return Nook and will bump up rating to 3 stars. Still don't care much for it telling me wireless is fine (but it isn't) and don't care for BN website.

I chose the Nook because I can read .epub format books on it; something you cannot do on the Kindle. The Kindle only supports .pdf files and ebooks in the proprietary Amazon.com format.

AWESOME! In addition, unlike the Kindle, I can read free ebooks available from Google.The only thing I don't like about the Nook and the Kindle is that neither one of them has a back-lit screen so, at night or in the dark, you have to have alternative ample light. So I either turn on a lamp or use the small, clip-on light I bought at the local RiteAid for about $10. It works just fine.So far, I have had no problems navigating my ebooks; everything works smoothly and the pages turn quickly. I'm enjoying the convenience of being able to travel with 30 books and audio-books at a time. I also have some music loaded on my Nook so I can listed to it while I read.

Some of the stuff is quite good.Finally, the ability to side load items from your own collection on say Calibre or other ebook source is priceless.

(I have a teeny tiny little hoarder of books inside of me!) But then I finally caved and decided to try one because of my difficulty in reading larger and heavier books laying in bed at night, and due to being away from home for periods of time where I couldn't easily carry a dozen books with me.The first reader I had experience with was when my grandpa had purchased one of those huge honkin' Kindle DS readers with the full key pad. I was excited about that one, but the price was WAY out of range. I decided to try and go with the Nook (after my typical pre-purchase ritual of spending days doing research on the best option) and I was so thrilled with it, I had nothing bad to say. I used that little beauty for a few good years, until I was forced to sell it to help pay bills. From the very moment the Nook left my hands I regretted it. I was certain I'd never find one that good again. And I don't believe there has been any readers since then that are that good still!Fast-forward to this Black Friday. The FIRST Black Friday when I actually HAVE some money to spend! And I am looking for a really good e-reader! I did come across the Nook on Amazon, and saw the new Nook Simple Touch, which intrigued me, because I wanted to stick with the e-ink display, and not have a full-size touch screen battery killer. Finally, I realized my love for the original Nook had never died, and it still had everything I could ever want in an e-book reader. I was even able to buy one from a vendor here on Amazon, who lived less than half an hour away from me, and it only cost me $50!!! I was SOOOOO excited!!Now, if only I had NOT wasted $5 on that stupid fake-leather black cover, that completely RUINED the casing on my Nook... :(", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 5, 2012", "summary": "After All These 'Cutting Edge' E-Readers..."}

Both have excellent features that make them both excellent ereaders.Here's a few on the Nook:  1- It keeps the book title, time, and battery charge visible while reading.  2-It starts up just a bit faster than the Kindle.  3-You can use your own photos for the screen saver and wallpaper.  4-it recognizes the table of contents in PDF books.  5-it reads EPUB file types (meaning you can buy books from Borders.com too and read them)As for the Kindle here are a few features I love about it:  1-I like the real keyboard as the buttons are much easier to push than on screen.  2-It reads PDFS much better than the Nook, more so when you have the PDF converted.  3-the page turns are a bit faster.  4-I prefer the black housing to white.  5-the reading page/screen has no glare at all (the Nook's little color panel on the bottom is very reflective) and it seems the print is a little darker.Both the Nook and Kindle are very easy to purchase and load books on.  I think the thing I was most disappointed in with the Nook are the covers.  They are not enough covers that actually close, like the Kindle and when sticking this reader into your purse or bag, you don't want the cover to open and scratch the screen/reading surface.If you are looking for a great ereader, you cannot go wrong with this Nook or the Kindle latest generation, in my book they are both on the top shelf.  Now if we could just get one that is a smashed together version of both their great features into one unit.Update:  After using both my Nook and Kindle for a while now I've decided I do like the Kindle much better than the Nook.  The page turning buttons on the Kindle are very very light touch, the reading screen does have darker print, and the collections feature is top notch.  Now my Nook, the buttons take some pushing to turn the pages, the reading screen is lighter, and the shelves option is ok.  What I don't care for in the shelves feature is I can't colapse the shelves to just show the shelves and then open them when I want to search in them.  I also don't care for the B&N; Library being seperate from My Documents.  On the Kindle these are all included together and you can sort them out using collections.  With the Nook you must use the naviation screen to switch between them.  I've also had some trouble with the navigation screen on the bottom.  I don't have large fingers and don't wear long fingernails so moving around on the screen should be easy.  However, when I'm tryting to scroll or select something on the touch screen I just can't seem to get what I want.  But when I don't mean to move on the touch screen but accidently touch it, I trigger a menu move.  It's still a very good reader, but when comparing options and usability, I'd choose the Kindle any day over the Nook.  I'll purchase most of my books on the Kindle and what isn't Kindlized will go on the Nook.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2010", "summary": "Excellent reader"}

Like any other refurb electronic device I've bought in the past, the only way to tell this was a refurb was by looking at the receipt.  Otherwise, it looks brand-new, perfect finish and screen, and so far, it works fine.  Downloaded a couple free books from the B&N Store, a bunch of Project Gutenberg books, something from the Google bookstore, and a PDF, and they have all worked fine.  Even tried out the web browser.  It works, but with the slow refresh rate of the e-ink screen and the small size of the color LCD, it's more of a novelty than something you would use as a primary internet device.  Unfortunately, the browser doesn't support downloading, so you can't go the Project Gutenberg website and download a book directly from the site to the Nook.  Hopefully that gets changed in the future, that would be nice to be able to do!  But this is not a make-or-break issue, just a convenience I would like.

We spent plenty of time researching and reviewing other e-readers and decided this was our reader of choice - I'm truly happy about the decision.  It was user friendly right out of the box, simple to connect wirelessly and quick to charge.  There are so many options for loading books on the Nook and one of the selling features for me was that I can take it to any Barnes and Noble store for free in-store downloads and reads.  I even love the fact that I'm able to download (check out) digital books from our local library online - what a bonus!  I have NOT experienced any trouble with battery longevity or overall durability.  I take my Nook everywhere and just toss it in my purse, complete with Nook cover of course.  I take it to school (while waiting for the kids!), doctor's appointments and even to church (gotta look up those Bible verses!).  My NIV Bible is loaded on the Nook which is wonderful - although it is a bit difficult to navigate through the books/verses in a pinch.  So I'd have to say I like my faithful, printed Bible for quick reference, highlighting and notetaking.  But, all other reading is done on my Nook.  The screen is clear and crisp, bookmarks are easy to use, books and documents are easy to navigate - and many times I'm fighting for control of my Nook with my son (9) who always wants to read it!  The only complaint is that the internet connection is a bit slow at times, but who really cares?  I've got my laptop to do all that.  And any questions I've had on the Nook - I just take it to the store for quick, reliable and friendly service.Use Nook as your e-reader ... less paper / more knowledge!\"Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.\" - Joseph Addison", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "10 27, 2010", "summary": "Reading = A+ / Reading a NOOK = A++!!!"}

I'd been excited to an e-reader, and when I was asked what I wanted for the holidays, my immediate response was a Kindle. I hadn't done any research, knew nothing about it other than it was the only e-reader I had heard of due to commercials, conversations, etc.When I received my Kindle, I immediately fell in love. I purchased several books using an Amazon Gift Card and carried it everywhere I went. It was the perfect size, the screen was clear and crisp, and it took seconds to set up. I had heard that my local library had a lending library of eBooks, and day after receiving my Kindle I raced over there to renew my library card. That was where my love affair with my Kindle began to fray.After getting my first book via email, I set about working to get it on my Kindle. Needless to say, this led to hours of frustration. I scoured the internet looking for a way to make it work, to get this ePub book to read on my Kindle. After an exhaustive search, I determined that without breaking dozens of international copyright laws are instantly learning how to hack or re-write script. I learned how proprietary the device truly was. In fact, if I wanted to read anything, I would have to purchase it from the Kindle store on Amazon.com.  It was with a heavy heart that I deleted all my purchases from my Kindle, packaged it back up, and sent it back to Amazon. To their credit, Amazon's customer service made the return process extremely easy. Within days I had my complete refund, including for the books I had purchased.Enter the nook. During my research, I had learned that the nook had the capability to do all the things the Kindle had lacked. It was specifically listed on my library's site as a capable e-reader, and allowed me the flexibility of purchasing from other sites, lending books to friends, or previewing books in store. I found a seller on Amazon who was offering the nook for its expected price of $149, not the ridiculous mark-up some of the vendors on this site are asking (in some cases $180???).the seller shipped the device quickly, and it arrived in the prompt fashion we have come to expect of Amazon purchases.I am very, very happy with my choice. While the nook is slightly larger, and perhaps a bit heavier, it performs like a champ. The e-ink screen has the same clarity and crispness of the Kindle, and the page turning feels sharp and quick, no different than flicking a page in its ink and paper counterparts. Setup was quick and easy,  I was able to connect to my WEP-encrypted Wireless network within seconds. I already had a B&N; account, so registration was a breeze, and my first book purchase was quick and easy as well. You have the option of purchasing from the site on your PC or perusing the store right on your nook, and the books arrive within seconds. The reading experience is fantastic, my love of reading ha been renewed after years of growing stale while reading and re-reading the covers on my bookshelves at home. I recommend a cover, of which Barnes and Noble offers a myriad of choices for both practicality and style.The only cons towards the nook that I have discovered thus far:1) The touchscreen, unlike the e-ink screen, has a glossy finish. It took a little getting used to the first time I read my nook. There can be a slight glare, and I recommend setting the touchscreen time out to 10 seconds. After just a few hours of reading, however, I forgot it was even there. I use a book light at night, and all it took was setting up the light so that it didn't reflect off the touch screen.2) The touchscreen is also not what we have come to expect with the advent and popularity of devices like the iPhone and Android. It can be slower than we are used to, but if you got this device primarily for reading as I did, this will be a minor annoyance.And thats really the only downsides I have been able to find thus far. Its also exciting having a brick and mortar storefront to visit with my nook. My first visit to the store with it, I was able to get a free smoothie from the cafe using a coupon from the screen. In fact there are several offers from the store page, including discounts and other offers. Add to this you can read for free in the store, and it just makes for a great experience all around. I stepped into the store, turned on my Nook, and it instantly welcomed me into the store, connecting instantly to their local network and filling me in on current offers.While the Kindle may be the more talked about e-reader, the smart choice is the nook. Until Amazon lifts the proprietary restrictions, the Kindle will always be an extraordinary device with ridiculous limitations on its capabilities. Go with the nook, you'll be happier in the long run.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2010", "summary": "The Smartest Choice."}

It does not have as much battery life as I would like and the page turns lag a little bit but the good things outweigh these two big cons.

My first attempt at owning a Kindle resulted in two failing devices for which I eventually obtained a refund.My birthday is today; my brother asked me what I wanted two weeks ago and I told him the Kindle. Unfortunately at that precise moment Amazon was right in the middle of rolling out the new Wi-Fi only Kindle and all models were unavailable.  So, I went for the barnes & noble nook Wi-Fi only.Considering my previous experience with the Kindle, I tried not to get too excited. I went on the net to read reviews of the nook and was fearful. I read that it was buggy, that it lagged when you changed pages, that the touch interface was not all that responsive.All of this was wrong; the page turns are quick and do not interrupt the flow of reading.  The touch interface is very nice and I like seeing my book covers in color. When you choose the Cover Flow, your books slide by with the touch of a finger and you simply tap on the book you want to read at that moment.  This was surprisingly helpful when I went to make purchases on the B&N; Store. I know you don't judge a book by its cover, but how many times has a nice colorful packaging led me to a book I wanted to read, uhm; many times. I was really intrigued with the \"swipe\" page turn that you used the touch screen for, however this did not seem to function correctly on the store model or on my own nook. Strangely, after a period of time, it now works perfectly. A representative told me it simply had to adapt to my touch...I don't know how much I trust that statement, however when she turned a page on the display nook it responded to her very well. (Perhaps it was a learning curve?)Side-loading documents: Wow, if you have any epub or pdf documents all you have to do is side load them and voila.  I do recommend a free program called Calibre, which organizes your books, helps you edit the tags, add a color cover, or convert to epub. Pdf is not very easy to read on the nook, but if you convert to epub it goes smoothly, unless there are alot of photos or images, which lessens the accuracy of the conversion. Calibre has even converted files like, Word-Doc, Html, Palm, etc. Calibre will let you pick and choose books to upload to the nook directly from the program; in other words it 'sees' the nook.Drawbacks to the nook: The battery life, that nifty little color touch screen eats the battery power like mad.  B&N; claim that you get 10 days, cut that in half. I do not know if this is because I use the touch screen to do my page turns or not,(the other option being the side buttons) but I am leaning toward, maybe? LCD screens notoriously use power; but using the page turn function does not require the back-light to be on, so I am not sure how it is eating up the battery so badly. It is honestly not that much of a problem for me. I am around my computer so much that it is unlikely a day will go by without it being attached to the CPU or an outlet next to my bed. I have gone almost four days with not re-charging; and I could see that little power icon decrease at least to slightly more than half in that time.Oh - and that nifty little cover flow on the color screen.  Don't expect it to work for Your Documents.  (There are two libraries, the B&N; purchased books and your side-loaded books or documents.) Also there is no way to sort your documents to your specification so you either sort by author, title, or the date you loaded them, very annoying if you build up a nice library; which is highly likely considering you can add an SD card to your nook and increase memory to 16 maybe 32 gigabytes. Speaking of which with that ability to increase memory, it would have been nice if the MP3 Player interface were a little more sophisticated.  An interesting ability is to play an unabridged audio-book and read the book at the same time. I am not sure who would do that, but then again I understand spoken Spanish more than I am capable of reading it.  This might be useful to me in that area, if I can find the matching audio-book/ Spanish-book. (Nuance in foreign language is often lost in English translation.)Never having owned a functioning 3G eBook-reader, I never really missed it with my home Wi-Fi. I have discovered several places close to where I \"haunt\" which have AT&T; free to my nook. I already have a huge collection of books lined up for me to read... so feeling a \"need\" for the 3G seems unlikely. I have always done this, collected books that line up, ready for me to read. (By the way... the in store B&N; Wi-Fi connection has s*cked at every B&N; store I have been to. Amazingly Border's free Wi-fi worked better, I just couldn't buy through the B&N; store. I had to go to my smart phone, buy the book, and it uploaded.)So how do I feel about my nook; I absolutely love it! To be fair however, had I received a functioning Kindle, I would have felt the same way about it, I am certain. I think the Kindle has deficiencies with the lack of a touch/color interface and the side loading documents ability. However, that screen kills the battery as I stated.  The reason for liking the separate touch interface is that you don't want to touch your e-ink screen; I don't see how Sony's all touch interface e-reader is going to be popular when you are smudging your read screen all the time, though I must admit I would like to try one out.The nook is comfortable in all sorts of positions, laying in bed, on the couch, holding it next to you; even laying it away from you and increasing the font so that you could read without holding it. I highly recommend a reading light, especially if you had grown accustomed to reading LCD screens in the dark (my kindle program on my Android phone.)It is rather frustrating, I would have preferred a Kindle simply because I was impressed with Amazon customer service when my Kindle malfunctioned.I do recommend the nook.

{"reviewerID": "A20Y7REXQZ1REW", "asin": "1400532620", "reviewerName": "Ryan Kurtz", "helpful": [11, 11], "unixReviewTime": 1293926400, "reviewText": "First off, I want to start out by saying that I love my Nook. My friend is an employee of B&N; so he was there to help guide me along in my selection and answer any questions I had. So, yes, I did have a little bias to the product to begin with. However, for what I need, this is perfect in almost every single way. In my review I'll compare the Nook to the Kindle ($139 version) and it's major differences, just so people know what I'm talking about in terms of other products as we go down the list.The Bad (If you want to call it that):1. The Nook is a little heavier than the Kindle. I'm not sure of the exact weight differences, but just by feel alone it is a tad bit heavier. Now, that can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. I for one don't find it to be a deal buster, the weight is not catastrophically heavier and uncomfortable, but it is heavier than the Kindle. I do think, however, that the durability of the Nook is a little better compared to the Kindle. The Nook has built in paddles to turn the pages, while the Kindle has flappy paddles along the side that feel as though they could break if I dropped it on it's side or if I touched it to hard. My suggestion for anyone interested in buying the Nook is to also buy a carrying case for it so it makes it easier to read, almost as if you were reading a real book. The covers at B&N; usually start around $30.2. The Nook does have a touch screen that has a bit of glare to it. Some others have posted their reviews of how they dislike the glare when the touch screen goes dark. For me it is a bit distracting if you find yourself wandering away from the text. However, whenever I read a book I find many distractions around me while I read. It's not a huge deal in anyway and some have posted if you turn it to the right angle you won't see your reflection. Again, not a deal buster in anyway I wouldn't think.3. The start up time is atrocious. I can't defend this one in anyway. Amish people can put up houses in a faster amount of time before the Nook would have a chance to get to your homepage. Ok, so not quite that slow, but you get the idea. I haven't timed it yet but I'm going to take an educated guess that it takes around 1-1/2 minutes to start up. That is something that should have been addressed from B&N; to begin with. Again, I can't defend this one in anyway.Ok, so what you have all been waiting for: The Good1. The extra storage feature is superb. The Nook comes with a built in 2GB storage space. Enough for most people, 2GB will get most every book you want to read in your Nook with no problem. However, if you are a fanatic reader that has Newspapers and Magazines delivered to your Nook everyday or every week, this can begin to take up space if you don't free it up. But don't fret! The Nook comes with an extra storage slot for your SD card that can hold up to whatever the highest SD card space is out there. The great thing about it is, SD cards are a lot cheaper today than you would have found 3 years ago, so adding space is cheap.2. The Nook has a featured called \"LendMe\". This is something that the Kindle does not have and I'm sure for competition sake will have in the future. This a great, great, great feature to the Nook! If you have any friends, family or co-workers that have a Nook and have a book on theirs that you would like to read, you can hook up wireless or through the computer and Lend them a copy of it for up to 14 days. If you're a fast reader then you can knock out a 500-600 page book in easily 14 days.3. Your county library might be on the list of Nook rentals. In the county in which I reside in North Carolina, our county library is fortunate enough to have a system in which I can rent books for 14 days from the library. This also is something the Kindle does not have. Before I go off on how great the feature for renting books is, I should point out that the library is going to have a limited selection of books for you to rent. I'm a big Thomas Sowell reader and he has approximately 30 books out on the market. However, the county library that I rent from has only 1 book from his selection. So do you're research before you buy a book, your county library might have it already. The feature, as I have seen, is relatively easy to use. You do have to hard wire your Nook to your computer after you download some software, but it's really simple and the kind people at your local county library can assist you on how to do this. In fact our county library had everything we needed in terms of software and directions on their website.4. Finally. You can take your Nook to B&N; and read any book for up to an hour. Recently I went to grab some coffee at B&N; and wanted to read a book on Ireland. Popped open my Nook, connected to the B&N; network (already programmed into your nook for ease), selected the book I wanted to read from the list I searched on, and wam-bam I was reading a book. You can read lots of books on one Nook from their online selection without having to lug 20 actual books that you wanted to compare before you bought.In closing on this review I would say first and foremost do your homework. Go to B&N; or BestBuy and try out the Kindle, Nook and even the Sony Reader. Some will really like the touch screen of the Nook compared to the touchpad of the Kindle, but it's all in what you like. Some will like the fact you can Lend books and some won't.I'm sure I've missed out on something that others would like to know about the product before buying, so if you have any questions please contact me back here on Amazon and I'll try to get to you as quickly as possible.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2011", "summary": "Great Item, But Does Have a Few Flaws"}

Morales", "helpful": [7, 7], "unixReviewTime": 1292544000, "reviewText": "With these new ereaders on the market, the act of reading has come back to be a very \"in-style,\" technologically advanced and hip thing to do in 2010. Books are now less intimidating and more fun and convenient, and this becomes only more encouraged through Barnes and Noble's Nook.Now, to cut to the chase, the Nook can do most things that the Amazon Kindle can do as well, and while the Kindle holds some ground over the Nook, on an overall scale, if you're looking for a better and more convenient ereader, I'd say to go for the Nook.Both the Kindle and Nook have clear displays, but overall, I would say that the Kindle's display seems to have better resolution. The Kindle also beats the Nook on battery life (as you'll notice that the Nooks battery life seems to last about a week, whereas the Kindle about a month, this is due to the draining power of the Nook's light-up touch screen menu). People may also prefer the button keyboard operation of the Kindle over the Nooks sometimes annoyingly sensitive or not-sensitive-enough touch screen. The Kindle is also thinner and lighter than the Nook. Both have mp3 features though, which helps them. It's always great to be able to read to your favorite music.Now, while it may seem in this paragraph the Kindle has the Nook easily beaten, one must look deeper into finding out why the Nook is a better choice. The reason the nook beats the Kindle is easy - in its navigation, presentation and overall ease of use.The biggest problem with the Kindle (that I noticed) is that the Kindle seems to want to have the look and feel of navigating like a laptop computer in the way it presents the main menu and font size, style and book selection. The problem with this is one thing - this is NOT a computer, it's a portable book, and Barnes and Noble knows this, and made their unit feel way less like just another annoying technological gadget but instead with a \"browsing bookstore\" type of presentation. This is a very BIG difference between the two, and you can sense it even after just a few minutes of toying with it. And this is only talking about the OLDER Nook, I can only imagine how much more amazing of a presentation the color Nook can get with all of its full color pictures and extras.On top of this, the Kindle seems to have placed the turn-page buttons way too attached to the ends, so you actually end up hitting the buttons by accident way too often, whereas the Nooks buttons are more of a soft \"bendable plastic\" type, so you never hit them by accident. This, on top of the little things like being able to slide your finger on the touch screen to turn pages as well as getting book covers and previews, daily logs, etc, give the nook an overall more \"coffee house\" feel which the Kindle doesn't even come close to. And even though the Nook is bulkier and heavier, it actually is made of a more durable softer rubber-like material, and along with the white paneling it makes it feel overall way more professional and studious. Not to mention just more attractive and stylish. This is easily the hipper of the two ereaders. Therefore, things like slightly longer load times, heavier feel, sometimes annoying touch screen and slightly higher price are actually very tolerable once you pick up both units and see and feel the overall difference.Books are an old-fashioned type of entertainment, and while the Kindle tries to make reading and literature just another tacked on 21st century technological piece of unrelatable modernized hardware, the Nook walks the perfect line of bringing the \"old-fashioned\" hobby of reading to a hipper style for the 21st century without taking away the studious professionalism of reading or disrespect the art of literature either. The transition is so much smoother on the Nook that you'll forget you're even reading off of an electronic device.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "12 17, 2010", "summary": "Nook BEATS the Kindle Overall, Reading Revived!"}

I had been looking only at the Kindle, only because of their advertising, and was still sort of leaning in that direction.  The reason I have the Nook instead is very simple.  The day I decided to get a reader,  Best Buy was out of the Kindle.  So I went over to B&N; and bought the nook.  I am totally enjoying it.  I love that when I finish one book,  I have another waiting to be started,  without skipping a beat.  This is especially nice because I go back and forth to my daughter's frequently.  My grandsons love that I have a library just for them.  But that's true with any reader,  isn't it?I love that the staff at Barnes & Noble are very well trained and are able to help extreme novices such as me.  The store offeres workshops and classes too.  I had difficulty with a download not long ago.  The device said the book was there,  but it would not open for me.  Even though it was a free book,  I was given a gift card for my inconvenience.  Granted, the sum was small,  but it was still a nice gesture.When I showed HubbyDearest my reader,  he said he wanted one, so I gave it to him for Christmas.  Then he and I together gave our daughter one for her birthday.  Now my dear neighbor across the road from us is also interested in getting one.  What she doesn't know is,  her family is giving it to her for her 90th birthday.  They asked my advice about it.  I told them that she's bright,  had no trouble learning to use her digital camera,  and the nook is very easy to use too.  I know she's going to enjoy it,  especially being able to enlarge the print size.I find it very easy on the eyes; better than most paper pages,  and I can read for hours without fatigue.  If I could change one thing,  it would be the shiny frame around the page.  I would like it much better if the entire frame was the same matte finish like where the arrows are.  There is a good deal of glare there.  I'm used to it now,  but it might be a deal-killer for some people.The cover I got for myself, for hubby and for our daughter is black leather and closes with a zipper,  and there's a small zipper pocket on the front.  I have found the pocke to be very handy.  I keep my B&N; membership card, gift card and a couple of dollars in there.  There's also room for my driver's license and bank card if I want to travel light.  It's also the cover that my neighbor will be getting with her nook.Some reviews mention that the nook is heavier than some other readers.  That may be so.  But it's still lighter than the majority of books, and I don't find it uncomfortable to hold.September 24, 2011  Update:  I am still enjoying this reader, and find that I am able to read for longer periods of time with the NOOK than I can with regular books.  Probably one reason is the adjustable print size.  However,  today I made a discovery that was a great disappointment to me.  I decided to try out the audio book feature,  as there are times that I am busy with my hands,  but would still enjoy listening to a book.  So I downloaded an audiobook from the library.  First,  the volume is very low unless you are using earphones.  This actually was not a huge problem because would typically be using earphones anyway. The big problem is that the device does not bookmark where you stop in the audio book.  Instead, it kicks you all the way back to the beginning when you exit, leaving you to hunt for where you left off when you return.  I called Barnes & Noble and asked if this is the way they were supposed to be, was there something I need to do differently, or is there something wrong with my reader.  I was hoping to be told there is way to command it to hold the place.  The associate I talked to was not able to answer,  but she did take my number and promised to return my call as soon as she found out.  In only a few minutes later another associate called me back and said that what I was experiencing was the way the are.  When you stop listening to the audio book and exit out to do something else with the reader...for instance,  shop, read a newspaper, go to the library, visit my documents, etc.  it will automatically reset you back to the beginning.  So, folks, if you are looking for an easy way to have audio books,  this ain't it.  I can download books into my iPod instead, and hopefully have a better chance of picking up where I left off.As I said,  I do still enjoy it as a reader,  and still recommend it for that.  But if you want a user-friendly audiobook feature,  keep on looking.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2011", "summary": "I'm Lovin' It!"}

My mother-in-law requested an ereader for Christmas. She didn't have a specific brand in mind and I knew next to nothing about them at the time so I started researching. Of course, it didn't take long to narrow it down to the Nook and the Kindle. I told my husband that I really didn't think we could go wrong with either one of the two. However, I decided on the Nook because it has several options (lending books to others, a brick and mortar store to go to with questions, the touch screen...)that the Kindle doesn't offer.Of course, all of this got me to wanting an e-reader of my own. After a few weeks, I ordered my own Nook and I could not be happier. The negative reviews on here really amaze me. I have found the device to be very easy to navigate and understand. There is a slight learning curve to with the different controls and which buttons do what but that is to expected.

We've had to contact customer service only once and the representative was quick and helpful.I use mine every day and I do have to charge the battery every 3 days. So, I charge it! Big deal! Also, as some others have stated, the touch screen can be a bit slow however, I fail to see why either of these is such a problem for some.

I like the clock at the top of the reader so now I don't have to waste my morning reading time on the porch by constantly running in to check the clock in the kitchen to see when I need to get ready for work.  I like the fact that you can look at the covers of the books when you want to pick out what you want to read next.  I like that you can add so much extra space to your device (the Pocket reader only accepted 150 books before freezing and acting up). I really like the fact that you can preorder ebooks which will just download to your device when they are available.  I like the fact that the power cord is $14.99 so I can buy extra (one for home, one for work) - where Sony Reader's power cord was almost $30.00.  I like the fact that I can install my own new battery when the time comes and not have to send my reader off to have it done for me.  I like the fact that if there are any questions about the Nook, I just have to go to a nearby B&N and get the help I need instead of wasting time with emails only to receive vague answers from the techs.  All in all I think this is a wonderful device - exactly what I wanted.  I usually read about three to four books a week and being able to carry my whole library with me is great!  I would definitely recommend this product.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "07 23, 2010", "summary": "5 Stars plus 5 more"}

She is a senior citizen who was apprehensive about using the nook and I was determined that she would not go without her books.  It has been a month since she got her nook and it truly is her nook.  Explaining and showing her the features is a good bonding experience.  I wanted a basic nook and was glad for the features of slot expansion, black and white, battery life is around a week, ease of operation/manual on deck.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "05 4, 2011", "summary": "Learning"}

At first I was against ereaders since I'm a book nerd--I love the feel of the pages, the smell, etc--but the Nook made me change my way of thinking regarding ereaders. Navigation is simple, adding books is a breeze (I've used both B&N; and Calibre software)--basically everything you want to do/change is laid out in an amazingly user friendly way.The only problem I had with the Nook was the e-ink screen. My three year old knocked it off the couch arm one day and it messed the screen up completely, even though it was in a case. Otherwise, I can't think of any issues I've had with this product. I've tried the Kindle and Pandigital ereaders, but neither one compares with the Nook. It's pretty close to perfect.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "11 23, 2011", "summary": "I'm hooked on the Nook"}

I studied the various ereaders and tablets trying to decide what to spend my money on. Loved the idea of an iPad, but $600 is ridiculous for books, and it's size prohibits simple everyday usage. Android tablets seem too fickle and the technology is changing daily, without being upgradeable.So that leaves dedicated ereaders. Kindle was out for two main reasons: proprietary file format prohibits library rentals, and removable battery.

Smith", "helpful": [3, 3], "unixReviewTime": 1301702400, "reviewText": "I got my nook first and thought it was pretty neat until my wife brought home the new kindle. If you put them side by side, you notice that the kindle is a fraction of the thickness, turns pages faster, is easier to navigate (mediocre touch screen on the nook), has several times the battery life, and has much better contrast than the nook. The nook does have a slight advantage in terms of \"extras\" with a mediocre internet browsing feature and some small applications like sukdo or chess. However, and this was the real killer for me, the kindle can display word documents natively while the kindle can not. Also, the prices seem to be slightly better on amazon for most of the books I have looked at (Sci-Fi) and amazon's website is much easier to navigate then B&N;'s.The biggest problem though with the nook is barnes and noble. They shipped me a unit with a defective battery and agreed to replace it but never sent it. Three months later, 6 promises to send a battery, a complaint filed with the BBB, and there is still no record of them ever having shipped the battery on their computers aside from the one they sent \"somewhere in colorado\" but can't find any record of what address that might be too. Of course, they stock the batteries in every physical store but you could never simply walk in and pick up the replacement no matter how incompetent their phone support is. From all of my interactions and my friend's experiences with B&N;, this is a common experience with them and undermines whatever they manage to accomplish in terms of producing a decent product.Bottom line: The nook beat the 2nd kindle, but is terrible compared to the 3rd generation of kindle.*note: All software was up to date as of March 2011 on the nook, but still performed worse than the kindle", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "04 2, 2011", "summary": "Good until compared to a kindle"}
